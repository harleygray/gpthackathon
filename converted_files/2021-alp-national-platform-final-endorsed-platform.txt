Welcome to Labor’s 2021 National Platform  
In March 2021, delegates to the Australian Labor Party’s Special Platform Conference gathered to 
debate and adopt our National Platform . 
Our online Special Platform Conference was an event like nothing Labor – or any other Australian 
political party – had attempted before.  
Over two days, d elegates, branch members and observers joined from home, from work and from 
community spaces in every cor ner of the country.  
The coronavirus pandemic may have prevented our movement from coming together as we 
traditionally have, but it did not prevent Labor from updating and renewing our National P latform.  
As Anthony Albanese notes in the foreword to the Nat ional Platform, Labor’s historic task is to 
advance an agenda of fairness  that creates a better society, a better nation and a better world.  
The 2021 National Platform sets out the contemporary policy agenda that an Albanese Labor 
Government will implemen t to progress that great task.  
It is the product of countless hours of debate, discussion, and deliberation by Labor members in 
the 18 months leading up to the Special Platform Conference.  
I want to particularly acknowledge the work of the National Polic y Forum, particularly the Forum’s 
office bearers led by our National President, Wayne Swan; Senators Jenny McAllister and Deborah 
O’Neill; and our NPF Secretary, Misha Zelinsky.  
I commend the 2021 National Platform  to the Party and the people of Australia . 
 
 
 
 
 
Paul Erickson  
ALP National Secretary
Conference  resolution relating to the ALP National P latform  
That the Conference reconfirm the longstanding resolution relating to the Platform as follows:  
• Conference recognises that the Platform and Resolutions of the Party represents short and long -term 
aspirations of the ALP;  
• The program for each of the three years of a Labor Government will continue to be drawn from the 
Platform; and  
• Therefore, the Conference requests that the FPLP wi ll, in preparing the program for the next three 
years:  
(a) Continue to give priority to economic growth, a fair distribution of the benefits of economic 
growth and improvements in the welfare and standard of living of the Australian people; and  
(b) Implement other  platforms and policies according to a time scale to be determined having 
regard to the above overall priorities of the Party.

PLATFORM FOREWORD : RECOVERY, REBUILDING, RENEWAL  
1. As we gather virtually for a historic Special National Conference, the Australian Labor Party 
celebrates 130 years as Australia 's oldest and largest political party. Our party was founded in 
the struggle of working people who recognised that there was a need for a party, rooted in 
the trade union movement, to take their issue s to Parliament.  Our historic task has been to 
advance an agenda of fairness, and the creation of a better society, a better nation and a 
better world. We remain strong and determined, with our progressive instinct intact and our 
sense of moral quest undim inished. In 2021, our march forward continues. We are fighting for 
the things we believe in, and seeking government so we can add to our historic victories of 
which our movement is proud: rights at work, a strong social safety net, Medicare, accessible 
higher education, real equality for women, advancing reconciliation with our First Nations 
people, and environmental achievements including saving Kakadu, the Daintree, Antarctica 
and so much more.  
2. But progress isn 't easy. It never has been. Our forward march  has been interrupted many 
times: by the Great Depression, the Second World War, the recession of the 1980s, and the 
Global Financial Crisis. Each time, Labor stepped up to lead the country out of crisis – making 
Australia stronger, wealthier, better. Curt in and Chifley summed up the Labor way: "Victory in 
war, victory in peace. " Today, the Labor way means reform, recovery and renewal. It means 
undoing the complacency and decline presided over by our opponents. It means recognising 
that the world has change d, and knowing that Australia must also change to guarantee 
prosperity and a good life for all our citizens. In the current world of uncertainty, Australia is 
looking to Labor to lead.  
3. Since the last election, large parts of the nation have been destroyed by bushfire, our regions 
and cities were choked by smoke, and our people needed rescue by sea. Bushfire disasters 
aren 't new to Australia, but we know that climate change is making them more frequent, 
more intense, and more deadly. As the smoke cleared, th e pandemic replaced it, taking the 
lives of our elderly, stealing the livelihoods of our people, and pushing our already weak 
economy into recession. Businesses closed, jobs were lost, and our way of life was upended. 
Once again, Labor is called upon to re cover, rebuild and renew. Australia calls, and Labor 
answers.  
4. A Labor government will be on your side. Our opponents are using this period of uncertainty 
to sneak through dangerous hidden agendas that will hurt you and your family. Instead, Labor 
offers st eady, measured, intelligent leadership that is on your side.  
5. Whilst Australians have responded magnificently in making sacrifices to help each other 
through this time of crisis, the pandemic has also exposed weaknesses in our economy. We 
will ensure our na tion recovers stronger. We won 't let Australia return to past mistakes, 
where the wilful ignorance of science, a weak economy, flat wages and falling confidence 
meant that we entered the pandemic from a position of weakness. We will continue to value 
the e ssential workers who have inspired us and kept us safe.  
6. We have used the period to prepare the policy agenda of a future Labor government. Our goal 
is an economy that works for people, not the other way around. We know that trickle down 
economics only rai ns misery on working people. A better way forward – the Labor way 
forward – is to build an economy that creates opportunity for Australians, one that takes 
advantages of the opportunities before us. We are a great mining economy, with world -

leading service  industries, but we should aspire to be even more. We must be a resilient 
country that makes things once again – a country that not only invents, but manufactures the 
technologies of the future.   
7. Our central focus will be creating jobs – but not just any j obs. We want secure Australian jobs, 
with fair pay and fair conditions. Strong, smart industries create secure jobs. Weak, self -
serving industries rely on labour hire, algorithms and the exploitation of vulnerable workers. 
Labor believes in flexibility, bu t a good society cannot thrive when the balance between 
employer and employee becomes completely one -sided. We need to protect and enhance the 
rights of working people and the security that comes with a reliable job – providing the 
capacity to start a fami ly, get a home loan, and plan for the future. That 's why Labor will fix 
Australia 's employment laws to protect job security and give workers the rights and 
entitlements they deserve. Annual leave, sick leave and superannuation were hard fought – 
and hard w on – by the labour movement. Labor will fight to defend and extend Australians ' 
rights at work.  
8. Our people will be the source of our national revival. We see education as the ticket to a 
lifetime of opportunity and we will modernise our education system to  give every Australian 
an equal chance to succeed. We don 't want and won 't allow our young people to be dragged 
down by university debt. We will treat our universities as allies in a great project to create the 
ideas and products of the future. We will end  the neglect of TAFE by backing the skills and 
training of our people, giving them good careers in secure industries. We will help our 
apprentices and trainees instead of cutting them, and unwind the damage done by our 
opponents. For Labor, TAFE is worth f ighting for.  
9. Labor knows that we are a society, not just an economy. Our social policies will keep faith with 
our proud Labor history, but they will be modernised to address the changing realities and 
new expectations of our citizens. We do not believe peo ple's health or life opportunities 
should be determined by their postcode. We will narrow the gaps in health, wealth and 
income by creating opportunity and lifting up the whole nation. We will support our youngest 
Australians in their first years by forgin g the path to universal affordable child care while right 
through to ensuring older Australians are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve in 
their later years.  
10. Labor will deliver genuine regional economic development. We want rural and regional  
Australians to receive a fair share of the prosperity they create. In return, they also deserve 
the same standard of education, health care and community services as their fellow 
Australians. Labor will create opportunity and security for all our citizens  in all parts of our 
country.  
11. There remains much to be done to achieve genuine equality for women. True workplace 
equity and safety from violence will be national priorities. We will support real structural 
change to address the power inequalities in our s ociety that lead to unequal outcomes. Every 
Australian  – no matter their identity, gender, religion, race or sexuality – should be able to live 
free from discrimination.  
12. And we cannot look to the future without coming to terms with our past. That must sta rt by 
listening to the generosity of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and acting – including 
through a Voice to Parliament enshrined in the Constitution. We will work with Australia 's 
First Nations people to achieve recognition, justice and a strong voic e in our national affairs – 
because it 's well past time to complete the historic task of reconciliation.
PLATFORM FOREWORD: RECOVERY, REBUILDING, RENEWAL

13. All of Labor 's plans for recovery, rebuilding and renewal will be made possible by sound 
economic policy that supports Australian businesses and entre preneurship, but is prepared to 
intervene when the market fails. We will be strong economic managers with sound budget 
policies for these difficult times. We will have a strategy for jobs and economic growth, 
innovation and rising productivity. We will mod ernise Australia 's infrastructure and skills. 
During the Global Financial Crisis, Labor saved jobs with smart investment and by keeping the 
economy growing. We need the same approach now.  
14. Our policies will reward those who work hard to create a better life  for themselves. Labor is 
the party for those who want to get ahead, as well as the party of compassion for those who 
are doing it tough.  
15. During the pandemic, we have listened to the science to protect our health from COVID -19. 
We must also listen to the s cience on climate change to minimise its threat to jobs and our 
future. Action on climate change means more jobs, lower power prices and less pollution. We 
have the potential to be a renewable energy superpower. We will join with the world by 
adopting a ta rget of net zero emissions by 2050. We will use our abundant natural resources 
to build the batteries and solar panels and wind turbines that will fuel a new manufacturing 
boom and create generations of jobs.  
16. Labor 's foreign policy will use our middle -powe r status to pursue Australia 's interests and 
values in a rapidly changing region. We live in the most dynamic region of the world, 
experiencing the fastest growth of any region in human history – and we will turn this to our 
advantage. We believe strongly in the rule of international law and remain strong supporters 
of the United Nations. As we have always done, we will keep our defences strong, treat our 
defence personnel with respect, and maintain the alliances that have kept Australia safe.  
17. This project of national recovery, rebuilding and renewal must include all Australians. It will 
require an honest and mature debate and a renewal of our democratic institutions. The lies 
and the rorts that characterise our opponents must end. The obsession with marketi ng will be 
replaced with a commitment to truth. This democratic maturity and national self -confidence 
will be reflected in a new spirit of openness and will culminate in a national movement to 
establish our nation as a fully democratic republic. A genuine national integrity commission 
will restore faith in our institutions.  
18. This Conference will play a crucial role in determining the future of our country. By adopting 
this platform, a platform that holds no one back and leaves no one behind, we continue 130  
years of progress and action led by Labor. For more than a century, Labor has been on your 
side and we always will be. Now let 's write the next chapter of our movement – together.

CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA 'S PROSPERITY  
Security, resilience and opportunity  
1. Australia faces one of its most profound economic challenges in a century. COVID -19 has 
exacerbated many of the economic problems Australia faced before the pandemic, and has 
created new ones. Australians ' jobs, businesses and ambitions have suﬀered, with some of the 
greatest co sts borne by those who can least aﬀord it. Labor understands that good secure jobs 
give meaning to people 's lives and are essential for them and their families to have the physical 
and emotional security necessary to underpin a fulfilling and productive li fe. We know that 
people want their government to have a plan to keep their jobs safe and create great jobs for 
their children and our future.  
2. In this era of disruption and uncertainty, Australians want greater economic security  and 
opportunity —for themselv es and for the country . Labor will work with all Australians to deliver 
this.  As the party that saw Australia through the Global Financial Crisis, Labor knows that big 
challenges cannot be met with small solutions.  Labor knows the importance of Australians ' 
individual economic lives to Australia 's collective economic future.  We will rebuild our nation 's 
economic strength , help create jobs  and put Australia back on the path to growth and 
prosperity . 
3. Our task is not to restore Australia 's past but to restore its promise.  Although some of the 
economic challenges Australia faces are new, many are not.  For years before COVID -19 
emerged, too many Australians experienced stagnant living standards as wages, growth and 
opportunities faltered, and too many regions and  cohorts faced high unemployment and 
underemployment.  
4. Labor will pursue strong, inclusive and sustainable economic growth that is consistent with the 
achievement of full employment, well -paid and secure jobs, low and stable inflation, and rising 
living sta ndards for all . As the economy recovers from the devastating and long -lasting impacts 
of COVID -19, Labor will prioritise the protection, support and creation of jobs.  
5. Labor is proud of its record of strong economic management.  Fiscal policy must match the 
economic circumstances that we face.  Those circumstances include a weak economy with high 
unemployment, high underemployment, and high debt, which have all been exacerbated by 
COVID -19. 
6. Our response to these circumstances cannot impose unfair burdens on vu lnerable people.  Labor 
will ensure that markets are functioning, fair , environmentally sustainable  and work for the 
benefit of the Australian people , including through direct intervention where necessary. Labor 
supports an active role for government in add ressing market failure and improving equality and 
social justice through the full range of government policy instruments . 
7. Labor  will boost productivity and build a more dynamic economy, including through greater 
partnership between workers, their unions, business, community  and government  on 
infrastructure investment, skill creation , smart industry policy and regulatory reform , because 
rising productivity  is critical for higher living standards.  
8. Labor  will promote Australia 's international competitiveness , maintain a commitment to an 
open economy and increase the volume of Australia 's trade with other nations.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROS PERITY

9. Labor will build a more economically resilien t Australia that can interact with the world on its 
own terms.  The benefits of international connectedness have been significant for Australia, but 
this connectedness can create vulnerability during periods of disruption or extreme events . 
Labor acknowledg es that risk cannot be eliminated; national economic resilience is about 
managing this risk in the national interest.  
10. Labor  will promote private and public investment to create well paid, secure  jobs and increase 
Australia 's international competitiveness, and we will champion investment in scientific and 
technological research to keep Australia at the cutting edge of innovation . Labor  will make 
Australia a smart nation once again.  
Prudent fiscal and monetary policy  
11. Labor  will maintain an independent Reserve  Bank and its current charter objectives of currency 
stability, full employment and general economic welfare . Labor supports the Reserve Bank 's 
medium -term inflation target  and its calls for increases in real wages. Labor will support the 
Reserve Bank maki ng submissions to the Fair Work Commission 's annual wage review advising 
the Bank 's position on appropriate wage levels . 
12. Labor will deliver sound public ﬁnances by adhering to a ﬁscal strategy that is responsive to the 
economic conditions of the time, keep s spending to a responsible level and ensures that public 
debt levels remain sustainable. As Australia emerges from recession, Labor believes that a 
responsible economic and ﬁscal strategy should support a strong, inclusive and sustainable 
recovery that ge ts Australia back on the path to full employment as soon as possible, in a way 
that starts to tackle insecure work and chronic underemployment. This recognises that the most 
responsible and eﬀective way to manage the budget in the current circumstances is to support 
the economy and job creation.  
13. Labor will deliver a progressive and sustainable tax system . This will provide incentives for all 
Australians to work and undertake productive enterprise, while guaranteeing adequate 
revenue to fund quality public services, bring about a more equal distribution of income and 
wealth, and achieve the nation 's social, economic and environmental objectives . 
14. Australia 's taxation system should be efficient, simple, transparent and equitable.  There is no 
place for t ax evasion.  Meeting Australia 's economic and fiscal challenges requires everyone, 
including Australian and multinational corporations, to pay their fair share of tax.  
15. Realising Australia 's economic potential requires government to realise its capacity to i nitiate 
and support change through all the policy levers at its disposal including support for innovation, 
trade, migration, infrastructure and regional development.  
Inclusive and sustainable growth  
16. As a social -democratic party, Labor will pursue inclusive  growth . We reject the false choice 
between growth that is strong and growth that is fair . Labor  believe s our economy is 
strengthened when more people can contribute to it and have a stake in its success . We note 
that around the world rising levels of ineq uality have left countries more vulnerable to sudden 
economic shocks . Labor 's growth strategies will therefore maximise opportunities for full
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
6 
 
employment, equality of opportunity, fair wages growth, increasing social mobility and 
economic redistribution . 
17. Labor believes that full employment and well paid, secure  jobs for all who want them  are the 
basis of a good society . We will promote healthy wages growth because rising household 
income strengthens the economy and is the best way to ensure that the benefit s of rising 
prosperity reach everyone . To achieve this, Labor  support s a fair and balanced workplace 
relations system with strong unions to deliver better pay and conditions  for workers . 
18. Labor will work with unions and business to support greater industry and workplace 
collaboration. As a social - democratic party, Labor encourages companies and unions to 
replicate the success of other nations in making employees real and valued stakeholders 
through representation on company boards. In government, L abor will work towards the 
implementation of an 'Australian model' of company and relevant board representation for 
workers.  
19. Labor will examine options for improving ordinary shareholder rights to enable greater worker 
and citizen  shareholder participation  in the governance of corporations.  
20. Labor will make Australia a global energy superpower to tackle the challenge of dangerous 
climate change, reduce Australia 's carbon emissions, modernise Australia 's energy production, 
lower the cost of energy and create more well paid, secure jobs.  Labor will work with industry 
to secure investment in reliable, low cost energy that will secure and create well paid, secure 
jobs in high energy use industries, and push Australian industry to more complex, high 
technol ogy exports.  
21. Australia 's natural environment, with its soils, waterways, wildlife and coasts, is one of our most 
important economic assets . In addition to its intrinsic benefits, it supports our all -important 
agriculture, fisheries and tourism sectors . Labor's growth strategies will ensure these assets are 
protected and replenished as well as protected from the damage being caused by climate 
change . 
22. Labor  will ensure that young people are able to benefit from our economic growth strategies . 
Young people hav e borne a disproportionate share of the costs of the response to COVID -19, 
and must be given opportunities to maintain their connectivity to the labour market and retrain.  
Like their parents and grandparents, this generation should enjoy higher living stan dards, 
greater social mobility and higher levels of education and health.  
23. Labor will ensure that First Nations people in every part of the country should benefit fully and 
equally from Australia 's increasing prosperity . This includes access to well paid, s ecure jobs, 
culturally relevant employment programs, support for enterprise creation and opportunities to 
seek economic benefits from managing and leveraging Treaty, Native Title and Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander land. Labor recognises that that lo oking after country and the protection 
of First Nations cultural values has signiﬁcant economic value. First Nations people should be 
able to authorise and control and commercial opportunities arising from traditional knowledge, 
art and culture.  
24.  Labor wi ll ensure that speciﬁc employment and other social welfare policies are designed to 
ensure that Australians who want jobs are not left out of the workforce and have the 
opportunities and support to ﬁnd employment and grow older securely and with dignity.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY

25. Labor  believe s that rising  growth and  living standards must be matched by an improving quality 
of life . Labor  will develop new standards that complement Gross Domestic Product by capturing 
broader measures of economic performance and social progress, coveri ng: 
a. societal wellbeing;  
b. inequality;  
c. economic, social and environmental sustainability;  
d. technological progress; and  
e. economic activity generated online . 
A smart, strong and diverse economy  
26. Labor  believes  Australia must become more economically resilient,  and build a more diverse 
economy.  
27. Labor will use all the tools of government in driving an integrated approach to generating 
growth and prosperity.  
28. Labor will transform the Australian economy through science and innovation . Our innovation 
agenda will re-tool Australia 's industries, re -skill our people , build our advanced manufacturing 
capabilities and deploy and diffuse technology in a way that complements job creation.  We will 
strongly support the research capacities of our universities  and the techni cal capability of TAFE , 
and foster a culture of entrepreneurialism , innovation  and commercialisation  across the 
economy, from start -ups to established businesses and within the public sector . 
29. Labor will work with business, industry, universities and research institutes to boost Australia's 
investment in research and development as a percentage of GDP, getting it closer to 3 per cent 
of GDP achieved in other countries.  Labor will ensure that the Australian science and research 
communit y will be at the heart of this eﬀort to improve Australia 's performance.  
30. The development and deployment of new technology draws on a complex ecosystem that 
includes basic and applied research, public and private investment, research and development 
and an economy that capitalises on new innovation and technology . Labor understands that the 
role of government is to foster this whole ecosystem, in collaboration with private business, 
researchers and the broader community . Labor will encourage governments, ind ustry, TAFE, 
universities and other research institutions to work collaboratively in mak ing the transition to a 
clean energy future, overcome barriers to innovation and commercialisation, and meet the 
challenges of global competition . 
31. Technological advance s such as the internet of things, smart logistical systems, advanced 
robotics, 3-D printing, quantum computing , artificial intelligence  and other cutting edge 
technologies promise to revolutionise Australian business es, communities, and government 
services . Labor believes building a more resilient and diverse economy will require Australia to 
develop, adopt and integrate these technologies to make the products and services Australia 
produces more valuable, our businesses more productive, and our jobs better  paid.  Labor 
understands the benefits of technology and innovation, and will ensure that policy will seek to 
maximise the benefits of new technologies while ensuring social and economic justice in their 
adoption .
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERI TY  
     
 
8 
 
32. Labor will ensure that Australia is at the forefront of technological change to lift national 
productivity and competitiveness and improve the living standards of all Australians.  Labor will 
work with unions and industry to develop strategies to ensure that technological change 
delivers more high s kill, well paid, secure jobs.   
33. Labor  will invest strongly in research , including basic research and science,  and ensure Australia 
has the research workforce need ed to reach our innovation goals . To achieve this, Labor will 
invest in the creation of a STEM -literate workforce, including by engaging more women and girls 
and First Nations people in STEM education, eliminating discrimination in the science 
workforce, and maintaining a migration system that allows Australia to attract the best and the 
brightest from around the world.  
34. Labor will properly resource Australia 's publicly -funded science and research agencies and 
ensure they are given the independence they need to support their critical contrib ution to 
society, productivity, industrial capacity and economic growth. Labor will put Australia 's 
researchers in the front line of our industries and public interest research. The Commonwealth 
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australi an Nuclear Science and Technology 
Organisation , Defence Science and Technology  and the Australian Institute of Marine Science 
are critical to this goal.  
A better connected Australia  
35. Labor believes that ensuring Australians can benefit from world -class bro adband and mobile 
infrastructure is critical for our prosperity and resilience, especially in the post COVID -19 era.  
36. Labor will ensure all Australians get fast, reliable and affordable broadband, no matter where 
they live or do business.  We will leverage a nd improve the National Broadband Network to 
advance economic and social outcomes, and create experiences that improve quality of life.  
37. Labor will develop policies to leverage next -generation mobile technologies to support the 
competitiveness of domestic i ndustries.  
38. Labor will improve mobile coverage in regional and vulnerable communities, including transport 
corridor black spots and areas with high natural disaster risk, ensuring these enhancements are 
guided by local needs.  
39. Australia Post employs thousand s of Australians. Labor will work to protect the jobs of these 
workers, encourage Australia Post towards direct full -time employment rather than contract 
work, and endeavour to ensure contractors will not be used to undermine the current 
conditions and ent itlements of direct employees.  
40. Labor will maintain Australia Post in full public ownership and ensure it provides a universal and 
equitable service to all Australians.  We understand the essential role of Australia Post and post 
offices for local communitie s, small business and e -commerce.  We will maintain and enhance 
the range of postal and other services offered by Australia Post across metropolitan and  
regional Australia.  
41. Labor will work to utilise the full potential of Australia Post as a public asset by  leveraging its 
unique national presence and capabilities to support communities during times of crises.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY

More trade to create jobs and prosperity  
42. Labor is committed to maintaining an open economy, promoting Australia 's international 
competitiveness and exp anding Australia 's exports to the world in order to lift national income 
and creat e well paid, secure jobs.  Australia 's economic diversity has decreased together with 
the complexity of our exports and this has put downward pressure on wages and the creatio n 
of well-paid  jobs for Australians.  
43. Labor recognises the importance of international education sector to broader economy which 
has been highly  impacted during the C OVID -19 crisis and have not received any support from 
the current Federal Government . Labor  will support the International Education Sector and 
advocate for the safe return of international students, to ensure that Australia remains an 
attractive destination for international students from around the world.  
44. Labor will set out an ambitious , fair  trade agenda in government aimed squarely at increasing 
the complexity of our exports in order to create more well paid, secure  jobs, strengthen 
economic resilience and ensure that every trade deal increases the living standards of the 
Australian people.  Labor is committed to trade policies consistent with Australian values of 
justice and equality, community views, workers ' rights and the interests of developing 
countries. Trade agreements must be consistent with Australia 's social and economic values, be 
based on widespread consultation, provide for appropriate minimum and enforceable labour 
and environmental standards, take account of social and economic impacts and allow sovereign 
governments to make decisions and implement policies in the int erests of their citizens.  
45. Labor in Government will not enter into and will prohibit through legislation  trade 
arrangements that undermine the Australian government 's capacity to govern in the interest of 
all Australians, including any provisions that obvia te Australia 's protection of local jobs through 
the regulation of temporary work,  waive labour market testing,  further limit the capacity of 
governments to procure goods and services locally; require the privatisation or contestability of 
public services; undermine Medicare, the public health system and the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme, undermine State or Commonwealth workplace laws or occupational licencing 
arrangements , or undermine laws that relate to anti -dumping . Labor will not enter into 
agreements that include ISDS  provisions  or that do not include skills assessments to be 
undertaken in Australia and labour chapters with enforceable international labour standards . 
Modern infrastructure, transport and regional development  
Investing in infrastructure  development  
46. Labor believes that b uilding a prosperous nation means investing in infrastructure . With so 
much needed to keep up with rising population and the changing climate, Australia ca nnot  
afford to let infrastructure be decided by politics and vested interests.  
47. Labor will provide national leadership to establish a national infrastructure agenda and 
framework.  Labor established Infrastructure Australia (IA) to take the politics out of 
infrastructure planning.  Under Labor, IA will be charged with identifying a long -term strategic 
pipeline of projects and be at the centre of a Labor government 's investment  decision -making 
process.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
10 
 
48. Labor will not privilege one type of infrastructure or one mode of transport over another . All 
jurisdictions  will receive a fair share of funding, based on community need and project merit, 
and there will be specific infrastructure programs for the regions . 
49. Labor will support activity and jobs in the construction sector through our investments in 
infras tructure, including in housing.  
50. Labor recognises that infrastructure investment can be used to deliver broader policy 
objectives.  We will particularly invest in remote communities to assist First Nations  economic 
development . Infrastructure developments wi ll take into account climate change, including fire, 
extreme weather events and sea rises, the long -term health and survival of the Great Barrier 
Reef, and the need to cut pollution by moving towards a clean transport system . All 
infrastructure projects wi ll prioritise the elimination of barriers to access by people with 
disability and promote social inclusion by improving access to jobs and services for all 
Australians, especially First Nations people.   
51. Labor is committed to an infrastructure procurement p olicy that delivers on our long -term 
economic, environmental and social objectives, whilst being supported by the highest level of 
probity. Infrastructure procurement policy will be used to support Australian manufacturing, 
apprenticeships, regional develo pment and jobs growth especially in secure employment. 
Labor 's infrastructure procurement policies will ensure regional infrastructure projects directly 
support regional businesses and jobs and First Nations employment, including training and skills 
opport unities. Labor 's infrastructure procurement policy will also ensure that entities that 
choose to tender for Commonwealth funded work will comply with their employee and 
industrial relations obligations in respect of their workers, contractors and subcontra ctors, 
particularly with regard to the fair treatment of workers and upholding their workplace rights 
including in relation to safety.  
52. Labor supports  innovative approaches to infrastructure financing and will work with the states 
and territories, and the p rivate sector to finance priority projects . We support superannuation 
funds investing in infrastructure projects when this aligns with the best interests of 
superannuation fund members.  
53. Labor will work with the superannuation sector, industry, unions, stat es and territories and 
communities to help  reduce barriers to superannuation investment in priority areas, including 
but not limited to infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, housing and the care economy, so 
superannuation capital can play a greater role i n ﬁnancing and supporting Australia 's industrial 
development in a manner consistent with the best interest of fund members.  
54. Labor recognises the important role of local government in delivering infrastructure and will 
work with all levels of government to identify and deliver infrastructure solutions across 
Australia.  
Modernising our transport networks  
55. Labor recognises the critical role that t ransport plays in enabling people to access important 
services and activities, such as employment, education , health care  and tourism . The quality of 
transport options available affects people 's everyday ability to participate in social and 
economic activities  and contributes to quality of life.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
11 
 
56. Recognising the signiﬁcant contribution of the transport sect or to Australia 's greenhouse gas 
emissions, Labor will develop a national approach to transition to a low or zero emissions 
transport  sector, including the development of support infrastructure.  
57. Labor will build on the proud record of past Labor Government s which led a national effort to 
make our cities more productive, liveable and sustainable . We will ensure modern urban and 
transport planning  practices, urban sustainability , and technolog y underpin all government 
investment decisions.  
58. Labor will plan for  future high -speed  rail links as a means of transforming interstate travel and 
regional development along Australia 's east coast corridor . Labor will also continue to invest in 
faster and improved rail across the nation.  Labor also recognises that intersta te and regional 
rail networks have suﬀered from decades of under -investment. Urgent action is required to 
ensure our major rail corridors can operate eﬃciently, reliably and safely. Labor will work with 
state governments to address rail infrastructure need s and provide a level playing ﬁeld for 
transport operators.  In Government, Labor will ensure more trains are built in Australia by local 
workers and ensure every dollar of federal funding spent on rail projects boosts local jobs and 
industry.  
59. Labor understands the importance of a strong and healthy rail freight sector to regional 
economies. A Labor Government will conduct a comprehensive review of the rail freight sector 
to ensure rail continues to play an important role in the movement of freight ac ross Australia.  
60. Labor recognises that strong prescriptive safety regulations are the foundation stone of a safe 
and reliable rail industry  and is committed to harmonisation of rail safety regulations to ensure 
best -practice standards and practices are appl ied consistently across all jurisdictions.  
61. Labor understands  the health and environmental benefits of active transport options, including 
cycling and walking, and will build these into all infrastructure project planning . 
62. Labor recognises that modern Austr alian intra -city and inter -city public transport networks are 
made up of trips using buses, trains, ferries, on demand transport, and active travel. Labor will 
work with state governments to increase use of all public transport and active travel  modes . 
63. Recognising the signiﬁcant contribution of the transport sector to Australia 's greenhouse gas 
emissions, Labor will develop a national approach to transition to a low or zero emissions 
transport sector, including the development of support infrastructure.  
64. Labor will develop  a long -term road safety strategy dedicated to reducing deaths and serious 
injuries on our roads.  This will include measures to lower the accident rates in passenger and 
road freight industries by tackling dangerous contracting practices in transport supply chains.  
65. Labor developed Australia 's only Aviation White Paper. Labor recognises the impacts of COVID -
19 on the Australian aviation industry and its workers. Labor recognises the importance of an 
aviation industry made up of national carriers supported by a network of small regional airlines 
with suﬃcient competition to ensure services and aﬀordable airfares for all Australians. In 
Government, we will support the aviation industry as it rebuilds post -COVID  including measures 
to assist aviation workers .
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
12 
 
66. Labor is committed to ensuring that a fair share of the transportation services for the carriage 
of minerals, resources and energy products to export markets are delivered in ships operated 
by Australian entities that employ Aust ralian seafarers.  
67. Labor is committed to workforce development across the transport and infrastructure sectors, 
including ensuring women, older workers, young people and First Nations workers are able to 
gain the skills and experience necessary to work in t his critical sector.  
68. Aviation safety is paramount for Labor.  A Labor government will ensure that the aviation sector 
is supported by publicly owned safety and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety of workers 
and the travelling public.  
69. Labor will ensure that aviation industry policy and employment laws protect Australian jobs in 
the aviation industry  and address the issue of unsafe, low paid and insecure jobs in the aviation 
sector. Supply chains need to be accountable, transparent and have enforceable po licies to 
address the issue of unsafe, insecure, low paid and unfairly paid jobs . 
70. Labor recognises the importance of airports as regional economic hubs and their role in 
generating employment.  We also recognise the concerns of residents near our airports.  Labor 
will ensure that airport regulation balances the economic activity and job creation on our airport 
sites with the needs of nearby residents, including minimising environmental impacts and 
enforcing regulatory controls that protect local communities.  
71. Labor recognises that Australia needs a revitalised, strong Australian  flagged shipping industry 
with a secure workforce . The nation needs a strong Australian flagged fleet to ensure secure 
supply of goods essential to our economy, such as fuel, as well as  to ensure the safety of our 
community in times of crisis . Labor  will amend maritime laws to revitalise the Australian 
shipping industry  and will establish a national strategic fleet . 
Developing our regions  
72. Labor wants all Australians, no matter where they  live, to enjoy the benefits of rising national 
prosperity . We believe our regions hold enormous potential for future economic growth and 
prosperity and that activating the regions requires sustained effort and investment . We will 
therefore continue our pr oud history of supporting regional development and economic 
decentralisation . 
73. Labor is committed to tackling high unemployment and chronic underemployment experienced 
in regional areas.  
74. Labor will take a strategic approach to decentralization to draw population and economic 
activity to regional centres . It will be supported by investment in transport and services and the 
sensible relocation of Australian Government functions and jobs . 
75. Labor will work with local governments, reg ional businesses and community leaders to identify 
and deliver meaningful regional development programs that stimulate economic activity and 
support regional communities and sustainable regional jobs.  
76. Labor will properly fund infrastructure investment in o ur regions . Under Labor , regions will 
receive the major infrastructure project funding they need to grow regional industries, support 
farmers and improve opportunities for rural and regional Australians . Labor 's procurement
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
13 
 
policies will ensure regional in frastructure projects directly support regional businesses and jobs 
and improve First Nations employment outcomes . 
Northern Australia  
77. Northern Australia makes a vital contribution to the national economy. To meet its signiﬁcant 
needs, Labor will encourage sustainable development in Northern Australia that protects the 
region 's natural environment, its water resources and its many social and cultural assets, while 
harnessing its potential, including the development of natural resources and greater use of 
renewable energy sources.  
78. Labor will invest in the infrastructure, skills and jobs that are critical to the future development 
of Northern Australia and work with state and territory Governments, local governments and 
the community to further develop its trad itional industry strengths, like agriculture, mining and 
tourism, and expand emerging opportunities in renewable energy, advanced manufacturing, 
tropical science and service industries.  
79. Labor acknowledges First Nations people are the traditional custodians  of the land. Today they 
are major landowners in Northern Australia making them key partners for Northern 
development. Labor will work with them to address systemic disadvantage, ensure quality 
education, housing and basic services, and provide training an d skills so that First Nations 
workers so they can gain employment as skilled workers and to develop Indigenous cultural 
enterprises.  
Building a stronger nation through migration   
80. Labor believes that migration plays an integral role in building prosperity for all Australians.  
Labor 's post -war migration program brought millions of people together to build a stronger 
country . It is one of Labor 's proudest achievements . A strong but fair migration policy offer s 
education, jobs, prosperity and citizenship, comb ined with opportunity , safety, security, rights 
and responsibilities . It provides the perfect recipe for a better Australia.  
81. Australia is one of the most successful multicultural nations on earth . Labor will ensure 
Australia 's migration favour s permanent over temporary migration, to create a nation of people 
with equal rights and a shared interest in our national success.  
82. The size and composition of Australia 's migration intake will take into account net overseas 
migration, its effects on employ ment and training opportunities for Australian residents, 
demographic trends and other factors, while responding to current and longer -term  economic 
needs.  
83. Labor 's priority is to ensure that job opportunities are offered to local workers first and that 
temporary migration will never be used as a means to undercut local wages, conditions and 
training opportunities.  Skilled temporary migrants can help Australian businesses to thrive but 
will only be used where a verifiable skill shortage exists.  
84. Labor will re store public confidence in Australia 's temporary migration program and ensure that 
temporary migration does not adversely affect the employment and training opportunities for 
Australians, particularly young people who suffer from higher rates of unemployme nt and 
underemployment.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
14 
 
85. Labor will  reform the regional migration program and  encourage skilled migrants to take up 
jobs in rural and regional locations only where skill gaps exist . Migration programs such as 
Australia 's Pacific labour mobility arrangements  can also play an important part in Australia 's 
international relationships and development assistance policies.  As part of our commitment to 
the Paciﬁc, we will review the Paciﬁc labour mobility scheme to ensure Paciﬁc islanders are 
given fair wages and are protected from exploitation.  
86. Too often, temporary migrants end up exploited or underpaid with some employers abusing 
the system for cheap and disposable labour . Labor will always ensure that measures are 
implemented to protect all migrants from exp loitation , including : 
a. requir ing temporary migrants to be paid in accordance with Australian awards or 
enterprise agreements and to have their wages paid into an Australian bank account ; 
b. ensur ing temporary migrants are protected by Australian workplace law and are not 
exploited through sham contracting or unethical labour hire practices give them ; and  
c. offer ing them 'whistle -blower ' status if they are providing evidence of exploitation . 
87. Labor will combat all forms of people smuggling, trafficking and exploita tion—by boat, plane or 
other means —to ensure visa and work scams are not being used to gain access to Australia 's 
labour market.  
88. Labor will ensure that no migrant is 'permanently temporary '. We will align the permanent and 
temporary migration programs and ensure that, where appropriate, migrants have pathways to 
permanent visas and citizenship . We will encourage temporary visa holders to consider 
permanent residency where the visa holders are working under successful arrangements and 
have prior ity skills which are in shortage in Australia.  
A strong, fair and well -regulated financial sector  
89. Labor recognises banking as an essential service. A strong and well -regulated financial sector 
contribute s to Australia 's economic growth, creates high -qualit y jobs and works in the best 
interests of its customers and Australians generally . Labor  will aim to make Australia a strong 
financial services centre for our region of the world . 
90. To provide the right environment for a strong and competitive financial sect or, Labor  will 
support the four pillar s banking policy to ensure adequate competition and protect the interests 
of consumers . 
91. Labor  will adequately resource Australia 's financial regulation bodies to ensure th at they  are 
properly regulated and fully transparent in their operations . We will not tolerate conflicted 
remuneration practices in the banking and finance sector . 
92. Labor recognises the increasing importance of fintech to the financial sector.  Labor supports 
stron g consumer protection for financial products including insurance, non -bank lending and 
new tech -based financial products.  
93. Australians facing severe financial hardship are often locked out of mainstream financial 
products and unable to access affordable cre dit in times of crisis . Labor will ensure that 
Australians in financial hardship have affordable and safe financial options when life throws up 
unexpected difficulties .
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
15 
 
94. Labor recognises the structural changes in the ﬁnance sector arising from digitisation,  artiﬁcial 
intelligence  and automation. Labor notes the speed and scale of these changes, and their impact 
on employees.  Labor supports the establishment of a tripartite (Government, employer, 
employee) Finance Skills Consultative Committee to establish an d oversee training and 
accreditation in the ﬁnance sector, in order to position workers for the ﬁnance jobs of the 
future.  
This Committee and its Terms of Reference will emphasise:  
• skills accreditation;  
• the portability of skills and qualiﬁcations;  
• a scalab le, pathways -based approach to training; and  
• the importance of ethics training for all levels of staﬀ to nurture public conﬁdence in 
the sector.  
Dignity and security in retirement  
95. Labor believes that older Australians have made their contribution to Austra lia's prosperity 
during their working lives, continue to make a contribution and deserve to share in Australia's 
rising community living standards and to live with dignity and ﬁnancial security in retirement, 
ﬁnanced through a combination of adequate super annuation savings, private savings, the age 
pension and home ownership.  
96. Labor believes Australian workers should have access to aﬀordable ﬁnancial advice to assist 
with their planning for a secure retirement. Labor will work to ensure that workers can obta in 
regulatory compliant ﬁnancial advice at a cost which is commensurate with their retirement 
planning needs.  
97. Labor believes a pension that keeps up with community living standards is something 
Australians should be able to rely on in retirement.  Older Aus tralians have worked hard and 
contributed all their lives, and deserve the security of the Age Pension.  
98. Labor acknowledges the key role of trade unions in setting up Australia 's super funds. Along 
with unions, Labor created Australia 's universal  superannuation system to give every Australian 
a comfortable retirement, Labor accepts a special responsibility for ensuring the system remains 
strong and secure into the future . We will fight attacks by those who believe a comfortable 
retirement should b e a luxury only enjoyed by a few.  Labor 's vision for superannuation is for 
the vast majority of the workforce to be able to maintain their working life standard of living in 
retirement.  
99. Superannuation funds are also a source of economic stability in the Au stralian economy, 
creating a pool of capital that supports investment in Australian businesses and social and 
physical infrastructure.  Labor will resist attempts to undermine superannuation, and will fight 
to reinforce its sustainability.  
100. Labor will ensure  a progressive and fair tax treatment of superannuation . We acknowledge the 
importance Australians place in the certainty of arrangements when it comes to their 
superannuation savings.  
101. Labor  affirms our commitment to  the legislated Superannuation Guarantee of 12 per cent , and 
once that has been achieved we will set out a pathway to increasing it to 15 per cent.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
16 
 
102. Labor  will protect Australians from missing out on superannuation entitlements by ensuring the 
Superannuation Guarantee is l egislated to become part of the national minimum employment 
standard (NES) so it is enforceable as an industrial entitlement . We will reduce the extent of 
unpaid superannuation and improve people 's ability to recover unpaid superannuation as an 
industrial right.  
103. Labor  will ensure that all workers, regardless of how they are engaged, can accumulate 
superannuation on every dollar earned . We will not allow contracting arrangements to be used 
to evade paying superannuation.  
104. Labor acknowledges that women 's super annuation has been disproportionally impacted by 
COVID -19 and the  Government's policy response, and may take longer to recover than men 's 
superannuation, due to women 's experience in the labour market and existing superannuation 
inequities. Further, older women are the fastest growing cohort of people experiencing and at 
risk of homelessness and the intersection of superannuation and this risk need to be addressed 
and acknowledged.  
105. Labor  will ensure superannuation works more effectively for low income earne rs, women, 
young people and First Nations people.  We will pursue policies to close the significant gender 
gap in superannuation savings, including the shortfalls of those many women who spend 
significant periods of their careers as primary carers . Labor  will encourage funds to deliver fee 
relief for employees on unpaid carer 's leave . Preservation arrangements should reflect people ’s 
ongoing capacity for work and life expectancy, including in First Nations communities.  
106. Labor  will always place superannuation fund members ' interests first and will not tolerate 
misconduct or conflict of interest in the sector . Misconduct in the retail superannuation sector 
of the kind identiﬁed by the Banking Royal Commission is completely unacc eptable.  
107. Shareholders  are entitled to better rights, disclosure and transparency of their assets. 
Australia's  largest companies should be able to be held to account by their shareholders for 
actions, decisions and behaviour which may negatively impact thei r investment, and required 
to inform shareholders of risks which shareholders deem relevant.  
108. Superannuation  is one the most important sectors in Australia's  economy, and must be 
regulated and legislated in the best interest of members. Labor will create a Council of 
Superannuation Custodians, independent of Government, to provide advice on superannuation 
policy. The Council will be formed based on best -practice industry fund model comprised of 
eminent Australians with deep experience in the superannuation s ector, including trade union 
representatives.  
109. Labor believes that superannuation funds have a special obligation to their members to ensure 
they are true to their objective and invest in companies and projects which generate good 
returns but also operate i n the best interests of members. Fund s should have policies to ensure 
they are invested in assets which  are in accordance with internationally recognised 
environmental, social and governance standards.  
110. Labor will continue to require superannuation trustees  to act in the best interests of their 
members. Labor will work to reduce administration fees in superannuation, and support funds 
that return proﬁts to members ﬁrst.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
17 
 
111. Labor believes Australia 's superannuation funds should be invested to the benefit of fund 
members and in projects that create well paid, secure jobs and conform to internationally 
recognised environmental, social and governance frameworks.  
112. Labor will work with the superannuation industry and business to improve company 
sustainability repor ting on their environmental, social and governance performance in 
conformance with emerging global standards.  
113. Labor supports equal representation governance of superannuation boards  and opposes the 
mandating of independent directors . 
Building a dynamic and  vibrant business sector  
114. Australia is best served by a diverse and dynamic business sector that is able to identify and 
capitalise on opportunities to create well paid, secure jobs and make the Australian economy 
more productive and internationally competi tive.  Labor will be an effective and collaborative 
partner with the business community to help achieve this.  
115. Labor recognises the major contribution of the micro and small businesses sector. This sector 
has many diﬀerent entity types and business structure s, including sole traders, partnerships, 
family businesses, and franchisees, each with their own distinct opportunities and challenges. 
Labor will partner with this diverse business community to ensure economic growth and job 
creation. To help small and mi cro businesses grow further , Labor will:  
a. pursue  tax assistance and simplification;  
b. lower regulatory burdens (including national harmonisation);  
c. strengthen competition laws with tougher penalties;  
d. provide better access to justice and finance ; and  
e. encourage the development of digital technology solutions that support higher 
productivity, strong growth and well paid, secure jobs.  
116. Labor  will help small  and micro businesses compete by :  
a. reducing red tape ;  
b. countering market concentration ;  
c. making it ea sier for small businesses to take anti -competitive practices to court ;  
d. regulating to keep power and information technology prices as low as possible ; and  
e. helping small businesses compete for government and private contracts.  
117. Labor  will put cooperatives a nd social enterprises on a level playing field with other small 
businesses, including greater access to capital and government grants.  
118. Labor recognises that foreign investment is important for jobs and the Australian economy but 
believes these investments must be in the national interest.  Labor will ensure investments are 
properly scrutinised in the national interest and any conditions are properly enforced.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
18 
 
A collaborative partner for industries  
119. Under the Coalition,  Australia 's productive capability  and ca pacity  has weakened, become less 
diverse and as a consequence there are fewer opportunities for well paid, secure  jobs and 
investment . 
120. Labor will collaborate with and enable industry, working at the sectoral level with business, 
investors, unions, researchers and other institutions and searching for opportunities to extend 
and deepen Australian industrial capacity , improve skills and training  and exports of high value 
goods and services . 
121. Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments have a crucial r ole in the application, 
monitoring, setting and enforcement of eﬀective building standards that keep the public safe. 
In recent years, an over -emphasis on privatisation and deregulation has seen a marked 
deterioration in these standards and the widespread use of dangerous materials. Labor will 
improve the ﬁre safety of Australian buildings and prevent the use of dangerous non -
conforming and non - compliant building products, with priority focus on the importation of 
ﬂammable cladding, national licensing, nat ional regulation of all building industry practitioners, 
and a tougher penalties regime to deter fraudulent, false or misleading claims.  
122. Labor recognises the signiﬁcant risk to consumer protections, public safety and workplace 
health and safety that arises from poorly established occupational mobility schemes such as 
Automatic Mutual Recognition. Acknowledging that signiﬁcant variation in legislation across 
jurisdictions exists and that existing mutual recognition arrangements are already in place to 
manage these risks while maximising labour mobility, Labor will ensure electrical occupations 
and building occupations that require licencing and/or registration are exempted from 
automatic mutual recognition schemes until such time as agreement is reached  between 
relevant industry stakeholders that adequate protections are in place.  
123. Labor will prioritise working with sectors that are in the national interest and have existing 
capabilities that can be expanded . Labor will build on the comparative advantage of our 
resources, agriculture and other critical export industries to drive production and exports up 
the global value chain to build Australia 's economic resilience . 
A real future for manufacturing and industry  
124. Labor will rebuild Australian manufacturing . The deindustrialisation of Australia 's regions and 
suburbs has had devastating social and economic consequences, squandered new growth and 
investment opportunities and hollowed out Australia 's economic capability . 
125. Labor will work to rebuild, modernise and  diversify Australian manufacturing with an active 
approach to government programs, collaboration with industry, unions and institutions at the 
sectoral level and supporting industrial development, particularly in regional Australia . Labor 
will work to cre ate a future for Australia 's industrial capacity in strategically important areas . 
126. Labor will employ a variety of means to provide a stronger future for Australian manufacturing . 
These measures will include:  
a. supporting the transition to modern clean forms of energy to deliver affordable, reliable 
and increasingly clean energy to Australian industry , while recognising the special 
requirements of energy -intensive forms of heavy manufacturing ;
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
19 
 
b. delivering high -quality skills and training for manufacturing workers through enhanced 
and secure funding for TAFE and universities through Jobs and Skills Australia;  
c. the continuing use of taxation measures to foster research and development and 
investment in new plant and equipment ; 
d. procurement policie s; 
e. supporting speciﬁc policy interventions to grow our domestic supply chain and assist small 
businesses to become medium and large businesses;  
f. fostering collaboration between industry, unions and research institutions through 
industry innovation councils ; and 
g. supporting Buy Australia programs.  
127. Labor believes that in its role as a major purchaser of goods and services, government play s an 
important role  in fostering Australian industries, particularly emerging industries or companies . 
Labor will promote a p rocurement strategy to safeguard and grow skills, investment and jobs 
within existing international obligations . This procurement strategy will have processes free of 
corruption and discrimination, lead on sustainability and ethical procurement practices, and 
ensure that robust and objective public interest tests occur in all cases . Our procurement 
strategies will support the growth of a strong  First Nations business sector.  
A strong services sector  
128. Labor recognises the value provided to the economy by the entire services sector which makes 
up a large part of the Australian economy, representing over 70 per cent of Australia 's gross 
domestic product and employing four out of every five Australians . 
129. Labor believes that growing the services sector will be crit ical to the future living standards of 
Australians and acknowledges the particular impact that COVID -19 has had on certain parts of 
the services sector such as education and tourism.  Australians are getting older, and have 
growing expectations for the type s and standard of care that we will receive throughout our 
lives.  Labor recognises that more Australians will receive and be involved in delivering human 
services – in particular care services – and this represents a boost to our economy and our way 
of lif e. 
130. Government has an important role to play as the designer of many service delivery programs, 
the ultimate funder of many services that are delivered, and the setter of quality expectations.  
Labor believes that a properly resourced and enabled public serv ice is necessary in order to 
ensure that care services are delivered in a way which is productive and benefits all Australians.  
131. In recognition of the wealth and jobs created by the services sector, Labor will promote services 
sector innovation and identify  the capabilities needed to establish Australia as a leading global 
trade  in services economy.  
A better future for farmers , fishers and foresters  
132. Labor will help Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries to capitalise on their 
economic and employment potential in a world of climate change, rising population and 
growing demand for high quality healthy food  and sustainable ﬁbre, timber and wood products . 
To help grow the sector, Labor will work in close cooperation with the states, territories , 
industries and unions to:
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
20 
 
a. support new export opportunities in  both  bulk commodity and premium markets, 
including gaining access to markets that have faced the greatest resistance from our 
trading partners ; 
b. work to attract domestic and foreign capital ; 
c. increase levels and quality of agricultural research and development ; 
d. ensure Australia maintains its status as having the world 's best biosecurity system ; 
e. develop the skilled workforce the sector needs ;  
f. work with the sector to improve climate adaption programs, harness opportunities for 
carbon farming, and promote the embra ce of renewable energy opportunities ; 
g. ensure our school and post -school education and training systems meet the needs of the 
modern agricultural , ﬁsheries and forestry sectors by addressing challenges of training 
delivery in thin markets including in rural, regional and remote areas;   
h. maintain an independent, scientific regulatory system for genetically modified crops to 
ensure farmers ' access to biotechnology innovations whilst respecting the genetically 
modified organism moratorium of any state or te rritory ; 
i. improve digital connectivity; and  
j. invest in infrastructure to support the development of the sector ; 
k. support farmers to prepare for and manage drought conditions ; 
l. develop a comprehensive forest plantation strategy; and  
m. encourage downstream process ing of agriculture, ﬁsheries and forestry products, and 
public and private investment in the necessary infrastructure . 
Resources for the nation  
133. Labor recognises and values the economic and employment contribution of Australia 's mining 
and extractive resour ces industries including iron ore, coal, uranium, nickel, rare earths, gold, 
copper, zinc, silver, gas, bauxite and others. Labor notes the critical importance these industries 
play in Australia 's economic prosperity, particularly in Australia 's terms of t rade, as well in 
supporting regional Australian communities. Labor recognises the important role that  existing 
and emerging resources can play in the expansion of existing industries as well as in the 
development of new Australian renewable energy manufact uring industries.  
134. In recognition of the vast contribution resources make to Australia 's prosperity, Labor will 
develop Australia 's natural resources through competitive minerals, resources and energy 
industr ies, backed by quality infrastructure links, whic h grow export -oriented jobs for our 
modern economy . Labor will:  
a. promote the ecologically sustainable development of Australia's energy resources, taking 
into account domestic industrial, home and community needs and the need to ensure 
security of domestic electricity and gas  supplies which encourage investment and support 
properly functioning gas and electricity markets ; 
b. promote opportunities for Australian companies and workers to enter the global supply 
chains of multinational resource companies ;
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
21 
 
c. encourage the development of low emission technologies, re -use and storage 
technologies ; 
d. encourage downstream processing of minerals, resources and energy products, and 
public and private investment in the necessary infrastructure ; 
e. assist the commercialisation and export of minerals -related services and technology ; 
f. ensure an efficient national energy market enhances Australia 's natural advantages in 
downstream minerals processing for domestic and export markets ; and  
g. support modern maritime engi neering excellence in export gas production, including the 
involvement of Australian engineering and industry within the supply chain.  
135. Labor will ensure resource  development on First Nations people ’s land proceeds in partnership 
with First Nations people  consistent with Labor 's land rights and native title policy  and Treaty , 
improves employment, business, education and training opportunities, and lifts community 
development and self -determination opportunities.  
Growing t ourism  
136. In recognition of its importa nce to economic growth and employment, Labor will : 
a. maintain tourism as a national investment priority ;  
b. support tax  and visa  arrangements conducive to the industry 's growth ;  
c. support robust data collection to inform investment;  
d. provide for a well -trained workforce, including through skilled migration ; and  
e. support the domestic and international marketing efforts of Tourism Australia .  
137. Labor will grow regional tourism, including through investment in infrastructure and domestic 
and international marketing t o encourage regional dispersal and longer stays . 
138. Recognising the worldwide interest in  First Nations people's  culture, and the importance of 
tourism to First Nations people's  employment, Labor  will support efforts by First Nations people  
to develop tourism employment and businesses.  
Sport  for all  
139. Sport and recreation bring millions of Australians together to build stronger communities and 
healthier citizens . They are of particular importance to regional communities, young people and 
child ren. In acknowledgement of this, Labor will provide strong support to local sporting clubs 
right across Australia to help them reach more Australians and improve their sporting 
infrastructure.  
140. Labor believes that nobody in Australia should be denied the ch ance to participate in sport . 
Labor supports measures designed to ensure that everybody can access sporting opportunities 
and feel safe to do so . This includes supporting measures to eradicate derogatory behaviour 
and sexual violence . 
141. Labor will support ou r elite athletes and improve elite pathways, to keep Australia at the 
forefront of Olympic, Paralympic and other international sport and deliver success on the 
international stage.
CHAPTER 1: BUILDING AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY   
     
 
22 
 
142. Labor will ensure Australia is at the forefront of efforts against doping and match fixing in sport 
and, in partnership with sports, will provide leadership in the international effort to protect the 
integrity of sport . 
A creative culture: a rts and entertainment  
143. Labor recognises that arts and culture contribute to innovat ion, prosperity and Australia's  
diplomatic eﬀorts around the world. Unlike the Coalition, Labor will articulate policies and plans 
that ensure the vibrancy and sustainability of creative sectors, markets and institutions and 
integrate these within our broa der social and economic goals.  Recognising the importance of 
access to arts and culture, Labor will ensure that Australians, regardless of their background or 
where they live, can access high quality arts and cultural experiences.  
144. Labor in government will work with federal and state governments to eliminate the many 
obstacles faced by the live  music industry, to provide a stronger foundation for Australian music.  
145. Recognising that art and culture contribute to innovation and prosperity, Labor will integrate 
art and culture policy within our broader social and economic goals, including recognising the 
important role that the arts can play in Australia 's diplomatic efforts around the world . 
146. Labor will provide strong support to protect and promote First Nation s people 's culture.  
147. Labor will support legal frameworks and safeguards to protect artists . This includes the legal 
framework of copyright to ensure fair distribution of income , and ensuri ng the authenticity and 
originality of First Nation s people's  artworks and cultural goods are protected from inauthentic 
imports and practices .
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
23 
 
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE  
An economy that works for everyone  
1. Labor is proud of its roots as a party fou nded by the union movement to give a better life to 
Australians . For some 130 years we have worked with unions to lift wages and salaries, improve 
conditions, pursue workplace equality for all and build a strong social wage through ground -
breaking  advances  in health, education, welfare and retirement policies . Together we have 
helped lift living standards, life expectancy and the quality of life for every Australian.  
2. Today Australians confront new issues related to their working lives . Even before COVID -19 
Australians faced stagnating wages . Contracting, franchising, outsourcing and other legal 
devices have disrupted long established employment relationships, contributing to rising levels 
of insecurity and inequality . The digital divide is also well document ed and impacts on people ’s 
capacity to participate in both employment and education.  Manufacturing and other industries 
that traditionally supplied secure and well -paid employment are under pressure from changing 
patterns of global economic trade . 
3. COVID -19 has exacerbated these existing issues and created new challenges , particularly for 
many service industries such as those providing personal care, hospitality and retail.  Too many 
Australians now find themselves without work, or with less work than they wo uld like . Labor 
will get Australians back to work by creating more and better jobs.  We will support economic 
growth to get Australia back on the path to full employment.  Australians returning to the 
workforce should not face the prospect of insecure jobs without the protections and certainty 
that previous generations have relied on to buy a house, raise a family, or build their lives . Labor 
believes that in the workplace there is a need for  new rights, new forms of equality that 
recognise the  full range of human diversity, new types of safety and a better balance between 
work and life . 
4. Labor believes that Australia is and should be a fair wage country . Competitive external 
pressures on our economy cause some to argue for a cut to Australian wa ges and conditions . 
This would be bad for confidence and demand, damage economic growth, and put Australia on 
a race to the bottom on wages and conditions . Australia’s fair wage system and higher minimum 
wage lessens inequality in Australia . When workers r eceive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work, 
they can invest in the future for themselves and their families . Australia can only ultimately 
succeed by being better, not cheaper, than our competitors in the world.  
Building full employment and higher workf orce participation  
5. Labor is committed to achieving full employment and work towards reducing involuntary, 
unemployment, which  will see hundreds of thousands more people in work, increase 
opportunities for disadvantaged jobseekers, and put upward pressure on wages. Recent 
decades have seen a rise in underemployment: workers who would like more hours. 
Underemployment especially aﬀects women and low -skilled workers. Not only does full 
employment mean more jobs, it also means more hours for those that  want them.
CHAPTE R 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
24 
 
5. Labor will create an eﬀective employment services system, including through utilising the public 
service to assist in research, planning, coordination and delivery, to help people achieve 
sustainable and meaningful employment and to help emplo yers meet their labour and skill 
needs. We will ensure mutual obligations in the Commonwealth employment services network 
are fair. Employment service network incentives for employment service providers and 
jobseekers will be aligned to best match employer s with appropriately skilled employees, and 
the improve jobseeker skill sets to better match employment outcomes. Additional eﬀorts will 
be targeted to disadvantaged job seekers and to communities disrupted by economic change, 
including co -designed program s to meet the speciﬁc needs of First Nations people.  
6. Labor believes that any person who wants to work should be provided the opportunity to work. 
State level job programs have shown success in matching jobseekers with jobs. Labor will 
explore the eﬃcacy of  implementing a federal jobs program matching unemployed workers 
with jobs that meet their skill sets, to reduce involuntary unemployment.  
7. Labor is committed to working in partnership with First Nations people, their communities and 
organisations to design  and implement programs which create paid secure jobs and support 
people into long term employment opportunities . Labor will replace the discriminatory 
Community Development Program with a program that gives communities more control and 
delivers real wages  and real jobs.  
8. Labor believes that one of the great successes of the labour market over recent decades has 
been the entry of more women into the labour force . Labor will continue to support policies 
which remove remaining barriers, including those based o n gender, age, race, religion, ethnicity, 
sexuality or disability status . Diversity contributes to growth and equity.  
9. Labor will work with business and unions to grow employment opportunities for people with 
disability and create a disability employment sy stem that is capable of ensuring more people 
with disability get good quality jobs.  
10. Labor will support achieving full gender equality in the workforce by helping people balance 
their work and family responsibilities . Labor will:  
a. provide via the National Em ployment Standards rights to unpaid parental leave of up to 
two years ; 
b. give people the enforceable right to request a change of hours or other flexible work 
arrangements for parenting and caring ; 
c. give people the right to work reasonable but not excessive h ours ; 
d. expand access to paid parental leave to increase support for parents and promote equal 
parenting. Labor’s  goal is for 26 weeks of paid parental leave at full pay and with 
superannuation funded through a combination of government and employer 
contributions and increased eligibility  to enable paid parental leave to be shared. Over 
time, Labor will seek further e xpansion of leave in a way that enables more equal 
parenting ; 
e. deliver affordable, quality childcare and before and after school care, and will consider 
changes to tax, superannuation, work and industry arrangements to support this ; and  
f. ensure flexible work ing arrangements accommodate unpaid caring work, including the 
care of family members with disability, without discrimination .
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
25 
 
Better working conditions  
11. Labor supports a modern award system that is relevant to the workplaces of today and is 
responsive to c hanges in industry and market standards . Modern awards need to provide an 
effective and up -to-date safety net and must allow for improved test case standards, both 
within and across awards.  
12. Labor will work with state and territory governments to achieve a national minimum standard 
for long service leave to form part of the National Employment Standards . Labor will work with 
state and territory governments to ensure consistent treatment of public holidays, including the 
issue of Easter Sunday and t he treatment of Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day 
where they fall on weekends.  Labor also commits to ensuring that other signiﬁcant days of 
religious and cultural signiﬁcance are acknowledged.  
13. Labor will review the operation of the National Empl oyment Standards and clarify any questions 
relating to the application of those standards which have arisen since their introduction . 
14. Labor will introduce ten days paid Domestic Violence Leave as a universal workplace right in the 
National Employment Stand ards.  
15. Labor supports a minimum wage that provides a living wage and will maintain or improve the 
relative living standards of low paid workers . Superannuation is part of a worker’s pay and 
conditions.  Labor will legislate to include a right to superannuati on within the National 
Employment Standards, which will give all employees the power to pursue their unpaid 
superannuation.  
16. Labor will work to eliminate  the gender pay gap and ensure that the equal remuneration 
provisions in the Fair Work Act deliver for l ow paid women . We will seek to remove the systemic 
and structural barriers to the full and equal participation and fair compensation of women in 
the workforce . 
17. Labor will enact a strategy for achieving  equal pay for equal or comparable work , underpinned 
by legal and reporting obligations . Labor recognises the need for law reform to promote pay 
equity  and will make gender pay equity an object of the Fair Work Act. Labor will establish a 
new Pay Equity Panel within the Commission and fund the Commission to es tablish a Pay Equity 
Unit . Labor will ensure the frameworks and principles applying to tribunals and agencies reflect 
up-to-date research and knowledge about what works to reduce the gender pay gap.  
18. Labor recognises the need to ensure working women do not retire into poverty and will remove 
obstacles to superannuation savings which disproportionately affect women . 
19. Labor believes in safe and socially inclusive workplaces . There is no place for any form of 
discrimination . No worker should be subject to bullyi ng, discrimination or harassment in the 
workplace . Labor is committed to ensuring that workers experiencing workplace discrimination, 
or sexual violence and harassment in the workplace are able to address this through a fair, 
expedient process in the workp lace relations system.  
20. Labor will work with state and territory governments, employers and unions to facilitate and 
establish the portability of entitlements including through industry -wide schemes.
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
26 
 
21. Labor believes a practical industry -based system for sele cting default funds in modern awards 
should be overseen by the Fair Work Commission with input from workers, unions, employers 
and experts . 
22. Labor will support employers and unions to develop working time arrangements that are 
consistent with workers’ prefe rences and needs and that will reduce excessive working hours 
and maximise employment creation.  
23. Labor supports penalty rates as a means to compensate workers for working excessive or 
unsociable hours . Labor will prevent awards being varied to cut workers’ take home pay.  
24. Labor will ensure the workplace relations system reduces the incidence of underemployment 
and insecure work . Labor will strengthen the laws that prohibit sham contracting . Labor will set 
an objective test in legislation for determining when a worker is a casual . 
25. Labor will protect labour hire workers by establishing a national labour hire licensing scheme to 
regulate the labour hire industry and ensure that minimum legal standards are met . Labor will 
also legislate to guarantee that labour hire workers receive the same pay and conditions as 
directly employed workers doing the same work . Labor will not accept the abuse of fixed term 
contracts of employment.  
26. Labor will ensure that collective agreements are negotiated in good faith and genuinely agreed 
to by a representative cohort of the workers to which they apply . Labor will prevent the 
unilateral terminations of collective agreements that reduce workers’ entitlements . Labor will 
also provide an effective mechanism for the termination of any remaining “WorkChoices” 
agreements . 
27. Labor will work with trade unions and employers to ensure workers have access to adequate 
information about:  their workplace rights ; the right to join a union ; the relevant industrial 
agreements ; occupational heal th and safety ; and other important information at the 
commencement of their employment and on an ongoing basis . Labor will protect the right of 
unions to communicate freely with workers  about their industrial rights , including their right to 
join a union,  and other relevant concerns . 
28. Labor will ensure that the Fair Work Act provides appropriate coverage and protection for all 
forms of work and that gig economy platforms and other working arrangements are not used 
to circumvent industrial standards or to und ermine workers’ rights to collectively organise and 
access their union . 
29. Noting that poor quality and insecure employment pose s physical and mental health and safety 
risks, Labor will make job quality and secure employment central social policy objectives.  
30. Labor will work with local councils and unions to minimise the spread of casualised and insecure 
work. We will also work to ensure the contracting out of local government services does not 
erode or diminish local government services and is not used to cut wages, conditions and the 
job security of local government workers. This includes through transfer of business 
arrangements by local councils who are non -national system employers to national system 
employers.  
31. In recognition of the potential stress caused to employees and their families by fly -in-fly-out 
(FIFO) and drive -in drive -out (DIDO) employment practices, Labor will support industry best
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
27 
 
practice in work patterns, accommodation standards, communication technology and mental 
health support for FIFO and DIDO workers.  
32. Preservation arrangements should reflect peoples’ ongoing capacity for work and life 
expectancy, including for those people employed in physically rigorous and other demanding 
occupations . 
33. Labor will work with employers, unions and communit y organisations to remove obstacles to 
the employment of people with disability and to ensure people with a disability receive a fair 
wage and secure work.  
34. Labor will prevent employers avoiding their legal obligations to their workers through  evasive 
practices like : 
a. transfer of business ; 
b. corporate restructuring ; 
c. phoenixing ; 
d. labour hire ; 
e. sham insourcing or outsourcing arrangements ; 
f. misuse of partnership agreements ; 
g. termination of agreements ; 
h. unrepresentative agreements ; and 
i. sham independent cont racting . 
35. Labor will, where appropriate, extend responsibility for compliance with workplace laws to 
corporations that are the economic decision makers  throughout the supply chain , including  to 
franchisors and franchisees . 
36. Labor will increase penalties for employers and related entities that systematically underpay 
and exploit workers and pursue the prosecution of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act 
by employers.  
37. Labor will ensure the effective regulation of internships to protect inter ns from exploitation , 
including bans on unpaid internships that are not part of an accredited program of study . 
38. Labor will be a model employer in government and will not seek to reduce industrial obligations 
or terms and conditions through Government outso urcing.  
39. Labor will protect the integrity of the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme and ensure that it is 
not abused by businesses.  
40. Labor will legislatively protect notice of termination and redundancy pay as a basic employment 
right . Labor  will introduce a  Fair Entitlements Guarantee that includes : 
a. redundancy pay of up to four weeks per year of service ; 
b. annual leave ; 
c. long service leave ;
CHAPTE R 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
28 
 
d. notice ; 
e. superannuation ; and 
f. unpaid wages . 
Employers will be obliged to make proper provision for employee entitlements . Labor will 
develop further mechanisms to protect workers’ superannuation in the event of corporate 
collapse.  
41. Labor will introduce an improved ranking of employee entitlements relative to other creditors, 
ensuring employers and directors meet their responsibilities, and ensur ing any burden placed 
on taxpayers is reasonable . Labor will amend the C orporations Law to strengthen the recovery 
of employee entitlements.  Labor will reform safe harbour provisions  which allow companies to 
continue to tra de while potentially or actually insolvent. In doing so, Labor will remove the 
opportunity for workers entitlements to be targeted as part of a corporate restructure.  
42. Labor will support the work of the International Labour Organisation, particularly within  our 
region, to improve international labour standards and champion respect for internationally 
recognised workplace rights.  
43. Labor supports Australian jobs . Labor will ensure genuine testing of the Australian labour 
market before temporary overseas labour is engaged . Labour market testing requirements will 
not be waived in any future trade agreements . Temporary overseas workers are vulnerable to 
exploitation and this exploitation affects those workers and all Australian workers by 
undermining their wages an d conditions . Labor will ensure that migrant workers including 
temporary visa workers have access to adequate information on their workplace rights and how 
to join their union . 
Safer workplaces  
44. Labor believes that all workers have an equal right to healthy  and safe work. Every worker 
deserves to know that their working life will be safe, healthy and  respectful.  
45. Labor recognises that every year hundreds of workers are killed at work, thousands more die 
from diseases caused by their work and over 100,000 people are seriously injured at work. This 
hurts businesses who suﬀer from lost time and reduced productivity as a consequence of 
workers being killed, injured and made ill at work, but it has a more devastating impact on 
workers, their families an d communities who bear the brunt of the ﬁnancial costs as well as all 
of the physical, psychological and emotional suﬀering. Labor believes that we owe a duty to 
injured workers to support them in rehabilitating and returning to meaningful  work.  
46. Labor will  work to address the increasing prevalence of psychological injuries in the workplace. 
Workers exposed to psychosocial hazards, including unsafe and unhealthy work practices and 
cultures, are at risk of suﬀering harm, including physical and psychological i njury. Certain groups 
of workers, including women, First Nations workers along with those in insecure work are 
disproportionately  impacted.  
47. Labor recognises that unions make work safer and healthier. Eﬀective consultation, 
participation and representation of workers through their unions is crucial for healthy and safe 
work. Labor will continue to build the capacity of workers and their representatives to ensure 
healthy, safe and respectful work for all, including those in insecure  work.
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
29 
 
48. Labor  will work  closely with  the jurisdictions,  unions  and employers  to advance  a national  work  
health  and safety (WHS) agenda through a reﬁnanced, enhanced and properly tripartite Safe 
Work Australia, including by implementing the following key  reforms:  
a. Eﬀective and national ly consistent enforcement strategies to ensure compliance with 
WHS requirements, including for failing to genuinely consult with workers. These reforms 
shall also enable aﬀected workers, families and unions to again be able to prosecute for 
breaches of WHS  laws and require those who conduct businesses and their oﬃcers to bear 
the onus of proving that they have taken reasonably practicable measures to prevent a 
WHS oﬀence occurring. Additionally, Labor will support the states and territories to 
implement ind ustrial manslaughter laws and the development of harmonised industrial 
manslaughter legislation.  
b. The full implementation of all the recommendations from the Boland Review of Australia’s  
Model Work Health and Safety Laws and the Sex Discrimination Commissio ner’s 
Respect@Work Report. Labor will work closely with the states and territories to ensure 
that workers me ntal health is protected through the introduction of speciﬁc regulation 
dealing with psychosocial  hazards.  
c. The development of a national strategy on industrial disease focusing on reform to the 
regulatory environment for prevention, monitoring and response to industrial diseases, 
including deadly industrial and infectious diseases that have recently re -emerged, such as 
black lung  and cancer s as well as COVID -19. 
d. A speciﬁc national response to address silicosis and other occupational lung diseases, 
which will include  development  and implementation  of a nationally  consistent:  
i. regulation outlining minimum safety benchmarks for application acros s all 
industries where workers  are exposed  to respirable  crystalline  silica  dust,  
ii. comprehensive health monitoring program during and after employment to 
assist in identifying the  onset  of any  dust -related  disease,  
iii. dust  register  for all diagnosed  cases  of occupational  lung  disease  
iv. support (ﬁnancial and psychological) for workers (and their families) diagnosed 
with occupational  lung disease and who are struggling to return to work and 
adjusting to life with the devastating impact of  their  lung  disease.  
49. Labor  acknowledges the danger to workers of exposure to hazardous chemicals , including 
perﬂuorooctane sulfonate and perﬂuorooctanoic acid,  and will ensure the highest level of 
protection and support to the community, workers and the environment from hazardous 
chemicals by : 
a. ensuring the eﬃcient and timely assessment of all chemicals (including nano forms of bulk 
chemicals)  
b. adoption of a coordinated toxic use reduction policy, across multiple agencies, to decrease 
the toxic load on people and the environment  
c. supporting industry initiatives that encourage development of sustainable and 
environmentally responsible chemical  usage  
d. identifying those individuals and groups at risk due to use of, and potential exposure to, 
hazardous chemicals and substances. In additi on, Labor will establish a database using
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
30 
 
existing incident reporting and health monitoring protocols to record, track and support  
treatment.  
50. Labor will improve and harmonise the WHS regulatory frameworks covering workers in 
dangerous industries, including  shipping, oﬀshore oil and gas, stevedoring and oﬀshore clean 
energy and will retain Seacare as an independent Commonwealth statutory authority. Labor 
will also reintroduce a strongly enforced national safe rates scheme for all parties in the 
transport sup ply chain.  
51. Labor supports a thorough review of workers compensation schemes, including Comcare. This 
review should be aimed at improving the outcomes for injured workers in all jurisdictions. Labor 
will suspend any new entrants into the Comcare scheme unti l the review has been concluded 
and its recommendations  implemented.  
52. Labor will protect the community from exposure to asbestos -related disease, in cooperation 
with states and territories and lead by the Asbestos, Safety and Eradication Agency, by 
improvin g asbestos awareness and management and the prioritised removal of asbestos from 
the built environment. Labor will work towards a full world -wide ban on the mining, 
manufacture, trade and use of asbestos, including through existing international convention s 
and via a new stand -alone treaty modelled on the Minimata Convention. This work will be done 
in consultation with unions and asbestos victims groups, and ensure that the Australian Border 
Force has the powers and resources it needs to keep Australia safe  from dangerous  products . 
53. Labor recognises the unpredictable, volatile and dangerous workplace of ﬁreﬁghters, and 
believes this high risk  should be recognised in occupational health and safety legislation. This 
recognition should include appropriate safe w ork features including safe crewing on the 
ﬁreground and the principle of two -in two out.  
Defending the right to organise  
54. Labor recognises the right of all workers to be a member of a trade union to organize and act 
collectively and will protect the right of all workers to access union representation at work . 
Labor will ensure that our workplace laws provide the clear right for workers to communicate 
and meet with their union without interference and to be represented and participate in any 
workplace matter  which affects them . Labor will ensure delegates are able to organise and 
effectively represent workers, including through paid training leave . Labor will work with trade 
unions and employers to ensure a positive right for all workers to join a union witho ut hindrance 
or discrimination . 
55. Labor recognises that the right to organise, the right to trade union representation and the right 
to take industrial action if necessary are protected under international law and Labor will adopt 
and comply with all relevant international labour treaties and conventions . 
56. Labor will promote and ensure good faith bargaining in workplaces, including by developing 
guidelines on good faith conduct in negotiations to allow access to and assistance from the 
independent umpir e to resolve disputes  including giving parties access to arbitration.  
57. The Fair Work Act has not adequately facilitated multi -employer collective bargaining. This is a 
particular issue for those industries where employees are low paid and where they lack 
industrial power. Labor will improve access to collective bargaining, including where 
appropriate through multi -employer collective bargaining.
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
31 
 
58. Labor will facilitate bargaining for multi -employer and multi -agency public sector agreements.  
59. Labor will retain t he Fair Work Commission (FWC) and the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO), 
ensuring understanding of and compliance with workplace laws . Labor will deliver effective, 
low-cost, informal and prompt resolution of disputes through the FWC, the FWO and small 
claims procedures in the courts . 
60. Labor will provide a balanced and effective compliance regime, which will provide procedural 
and substantive fairness to all parties in the construction industry . Labor will abolish the 
Australian Building and Construction Commission  and repeal the Building and Construction 
Industry (Improving Productivity) Act, including the Code for the Tendering and Performance of 
Building Work 2016 . The appropriate body to regulate registered organisations is the FWC . 
Labor will abolish the Registered Organisations Commission and will refer serious 
contraventions of regulatory laws by registered organisations to the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission for investigation and prosecution.  
61. Labor, in Government, will repeal all ch anges made under the Fair Work (Registered 
Organisations) Amendment (Withdrawal from Amalgamations) Bill 2020 . 
62. Labor will work with the public service and unions to build an effective public sector with fair 
and equitable conditions of employment and job s ecurity.  
Education and training —a ticket to opportunity  
63. Labor believes that a great education system, which includes early childhood education, 
schools, universities and TAFEs , is crucial for a strong economy with well paid, secure jobs.  We 
see a great edu cation as the ticket to a lifetime of opportunity . We want every Australian to get 
a world class education , no matter where they live  or their circumstances , so they can get 
ahead, and stay ahead.  
64. Labor believes that an excellent education system is a nati onal public good . Great early 
childhood education, schools, TAFEs and universities are crucial for a strong economy and 
democracy . Societies with better, fairer education systems have better health outcomes, more 
productive workplaces, more social and econ omic mobility and more democratically engaged 
citizens . Our education system should also provide every Australian with the opportunity to 
learn throughout their life . 
65. Under the Coalition we have seen Australia’s education and training system fail our peopl e, 
teachers  and our businesses . School results are going backwards  while teachers are being 
ignored and overworked ; the marks needed to get into teaching are falling when they should 
be rising; public schools are being starved of the support they need; TAFE courses and campuses 
have closed and enrolments have plummeted; access to vocational education in regional, rura l 
and remote Australia and for disadvantaged groups is shrinking ; and thousands of people have 
been locked out of university, especially in the suburbs and regions . Labor believes that this  
failure has to end.  
An excellent start: e arly childhood education  
66. Labor believes that investing in the early years is good for children, families and the economy . 
It delivers significant social and economic returns to the country . We will therefore improve 
Australia’s affordable, accessible, high quality, integrated earl y learning and care programs .
CHAPTE R 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
32 
 
Early education and care programs should meet the learning and development needs of 
individual children, including children with disability . We believe early intervention programs 
for children at risk and children with specifi c educational or developmental needs are 
particularly important . 
 
67. Labor will maintain the current universal access to preschool and kindergarten program s and 
will explore  improvements in line with world’s best practice, including expanding it to two years 
before school . We will work with the states and territories to increase enrolment and 
attendance in preschool and kindergarten programs and ensure that parents are equipped with 
the skills they need to be part of their child’s educational journey . 
 
68. Labor believes that early childhood education and care is one of the most valuable careers for 
our nation’s future and that it should only be provided by a highly skilled, professional and well-
paid  workforce . Labor will support high quality training for ea rly childhood educators as well as 
improvements in their wages and conditions . 
Quality schooling for everyone  
69. Labor supports educational excellence and high achievement for all . It is unacceptable for 
anyone to miss out on developing their potential becaus e of class, geography, disability or poor 
quality schooling . For this reason, we believe every Australian child in every community should 
have access to high -quality, universal, free, secular government schooling . We see our public 
schools as among our nation’s most important institutions and accept the responsibility of 
resourcing them to deliver an excellent quality education that meets the needs of every child.  
70. Labor believes parents have a right to choose non -government schooling – this is consistent  
with a diverse and inclusive society. Non -government schools should be supported by public 
funding that reﬂects need.  
71. Labor will implement a properly funded national needs -based and sector -blind school funding 
model. This funding model will, in partnershi p with the states and territories, ensure that:  
a. all schools are fairly resourced to meet the needs of all students and have suﬃcient 
teachers and resources to undertake their educational role;  
b. disadvantaged schools get the biggest funding increases in the shortest time;  
c. schools and teachers have the resources necessary to give students with disability the 
same education and vocational opportunities as other students ;  
d. the gaps between First Nations students and non -Indigenous students are closed in all 
area s of schooling, including early childhood education, school attendance, reading, 
writing, numeracy and year -12 completion, including through a high expectation, 
strength -based  approach;  and  
e.  the gap between the achievements of students in metropolitan schools and regional and 
remote schools is reduced . 
72. Labor supports t argeted needs -based investments to overcome disadvantage , including a 
commitment to support students with mental health issues and those in juvenile justice 
settings . 
73. Labor  will ensure  schools  are socially  inclusive  and support  a diverse  society.
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
33 
 
74. Labor is committed to implementing strategies to address recent increases in the frequency of 
religious and racial viliﬁcation and bullying, developed in consultation with ethnic and religious 
communities and education professionals.  
75. Labor  will ensure school funding is linked to evidence -based reforms and practices that lead to 
higher academic achievement and better teaching and learning . All schools in all sectors will be 
required  to meet national standards in curriculum, teaching and learning . 
76. Labor  will oversee a national curriculum and national student assessment and reporting 
framework that is free from political or commercial influence  and developed in collaboration 
with teach ers and school communities . Among other aims, the curriculum must : 
a. ensure Australian children master the basics  early in their schooling, such as reading, 
writing, and maths;  
b. lift student results across the board, including for students who are struggling,  and 
students who are gifted and talented;  
c. support quality vocational education and training in schools ;  
d. include civics and citizenship education to develop in students a deep knowledge of their 
rights , freedoms and responsibilities and equip them with th e ability to play an active role 
in our democracy ; and  
e. include the teachin g of the history and culture of First Nations people and their 
contribution to the Australian story . 
77. Labor will investigate models of universal civics and citizenship education for A ustralian 
students, including a dedicated curriculum and assessment, and how to best equip teachers to 
deliver civics education.  
78. Labor will work to lift the status of the teaching profession and support improved practice and 
continued professional developm ent and recognise the knowledge and insights of classroom 
teachers by providing for elected teacher representatives on the Australian Institute for 
Teaching and School Leadership  board . 
Quality vocational education and skill development  
79. Labor supports a hi gh quality and trusted vocational education system that addresses the needs 
of students, industries and communities.  We will work in partnership with employer s, union s, 
professional representative bodies and educators to help Australians acquire the skills  and 
knowledge they  need now and in the future  to obtain well paid, secure jobs and build their 
careers.  Labor supports the development of a vocational education professional body which will 
ensure quality teaching and training in the vocational education sector through professional 
development programs and accreditation.  
80. The competitive vocational education and training market has led to signiﬁcant market failure. 
Public funding to private providers has led, in too many cases, to exploitation of students a nd 
proﬁteering at the expense of the taxpayer. Labor will ensure at least 70% of all public funding 
for vocational education goes to TAFE. The balance of funding will go to other high quality, 
trusted vocational education providers  which have the support of employers and union s, 
including in the adult and community education sector. Unscrupulous practices and operators 
will not be tolerated.
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
34 
 
81. Labor will work with states and territory governments to ensure TAFEs are resourced to be 
sustainable institutions that embody a commitment to quality and connection to students, 
communities, schools, universities and industries in their regions by:  
a. re-building and sustaining a workforce of professional vocational teachers and support 
staff cap able of delivering TAFEs multiple roles;  
b. collaborating with industries, unions and social partners to develop and provide high 
quality qualiﬁcations and training products relevant to the labour market, applicable 
licensing requirements, student aspiration , career pathways  and the development of 
decent  work ; 
c. supporting students, no matter their individual location, needs and aspirations, to gain 
education and skills for life and work to the best of their ability; and  
d. responding to specific policy imperatives  set by government, such as climate change, 
digitisation, and specific industry and occupation demands.  
82. Labor will strengthen apprenticeships and traineeships by:  
a. Expanding participation into new industries, cohorts and locations, while safeguarding 
qualit y; 
b. Establishing and implementing minimum national standards and ensuring contracts of 
employment and contracts for training protect apprentices and trainees;  
c. Supporting quality programs and higher skill levels so public funding and incentives are 
directly linked to a business training eﬀort, quality outcomes and development of skills;  
d. Ensuring all apprenticeships and traineeships deliver full qualiﬁcations consistent with the 
national qualiﬁcations framework, including ﬁt -for-purpose assessment and applicab le 
licensing requirements, developed through supported tripartite arrangements;  
e. Ensuring qualiﬁcations promote a combination of work and structured on -the-job training 
and an appropriate balance of on and oﬀ -the-job training;  
f. Supporting quality, not -for-proﬁt group training companies and enhancing their 
opportunities in sectors such as resources, major projects and for small and medium 
businesses;  
g. Reviewing and providing appropriate incentives, especially for small businesses in regional 
settings, payments and support programs to build employer and apprentice investment 
in quality apprenticeships and traineeships; and  
h. Pursuing a nationally consistent system of trade papers and harmonisation of associated 
rules . 
83. Employers of all sizes should be encouraged an d supported to invest in apprentices and 
trainees. Labor will investigate avenues and mechanisms to increase employer investment in 
training.  Labor will encourage the growth of apprenticeships and trainees by ensuring at least 1 
in 10 workers on major gove rnment projects are apprentices or trainees. Labor will also pursue 
a similar approach in other government funded workplaces like disability care, aged care, and 
early childhood education and care.  
84. Labor will develop and prioritise traineeships and apprent iceships in Local Government.
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
35 
 
85. Apprentices and trainees are a vulnerable group in the workforce. Employer non -compliance 
with apprentice and trainee employment entitlements is unexpectedly high. This undermines 
the value and quality of the apprenticeship sy stem. Labor will work with business and unions to 
eradicate exploitation of apprentices and trainees.  
86. Labor  believe s wage rates  for apprentices and trainees should fairly balance a living wage with  
the investments employers make to hire and train them . Apprentices and trainees should not 
be exploited as cheap labour, and instead must be provided with meaningful work  and training  
and paid appropriately .  
87. Labor will expand trades and traineeship opportunities for Indigenous Australians.  
88. Labor is supportive of all industries and sectors having access to industry speciﬁc training and 
skills development that reﬂect the tasks being undertaken by its workforce, irrespective of 
industry size.  
89. Labor will work to challenge gender stereotypes in trades and occupation s. Women should be 
encouraged to enter male -dominated trades, including but not limited to construction and 
manufacturing and engineering, and men should be encouraged to enter into female -
dominated occupations such as early childhood education and nursing . 
90. Recognising the importance to young people of making a good transition from school to the 
world of work, Labor will strengthen vocational education  and training in schools , as well as  
supports in TAFE for re -engagement with education and assistance into the labour market.  We 
recognise the need to create multiple learning pathways suited to the interests and aptitude of 
each young person.  
91. Labor  will ensure the vocational education and training system does not shift costs onto 
individual stu dents.  
92. Labor will support effective life -long learning to help all Australians to renew their skills and 
knowledge as our society and economy continues to change.  
Stronger universities  
93.  Universities are the leading centres for learning and research. They s erve the nation and are 
members of a global intellectual community. They are critically important institutions for the 
pursuit of knowledge and the enrichment of individuals and society, and they drive long -run 
economic growth and productivity.  
94. Labor recog nises the impact of COVID -19 on the ability of universities to teach domestic 
students, provide education to international students, and undertake essential research . Labor 
will continue to build a strong, autonomous, sustainable, affordable and accessible  public higher 
education system to prepare graduates for an economy driven by knowledge, skills and 
innovation, and to strengthen our country into the future . Labor  will ensure  our universities 
provide  excellence in teaching . We will ensure regional univer sities are well -funded to reduce 
the inequality in attainment between city and country . We will provide strong oversight of 
international education activities to ensure they maintain their quality and sustainability.
CHAPTE R 2: DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE   
     
 
36 
 
95. All Australians, regardless of their ba ckground or where they live, should have the opportunity 
of higher education . Everyone who has the ability to go to university should have a place . Labor 
therefore:  
a. opposes the deregulation of fees and the introduction of full fee degrees for 
undergraduate  award courses in Australian universities ; 
b. supports a fair and equitable student contribution and income -contingent loan system 
that does not create financial disincentives to study and gives students who take out loans 
adequate consumer protection ;  
c. will maintain a targeted system of student income support ;  
d. opposes the Liberals’ changes to university fees which delivered huge fees and huge debts 
for many Australian  students and are deliberately designed to discourage students from 
studying courses such as  the arts and humanities, despite evidence of strong employment 
outcomes for graduates in these ﬁelds; and 
e. will work with the university sector to improve the breadth and quality of courses 
available to students in the regions, addressing training and workforce needs where they 
exist . 
96. Labor recognises the crucial importance of university research to society and the economy 
through advances in science and technology, medicine, the humanities and social sciences, and 
the arts. Labor will therefore ensure that research activity is linked to its beneﬁt to humanity, 
to economic prosperity, and to university engagement with community and industry.  
97. Labor will ensure a minimum guarantee of funding is made available for important student -run 
services like early c hildhood education and care, health services, counselling, advocacy, 
entertainment and sporting facilities . Labor will support students in the creation of democratic, 
student -run representative bodies and safeguard the right for students to organise themse lves 
on campus . We support student involvement in the management of their university 
communities and in university decision -making processes , and will support elected staff and 
student representation on university councils  
98. Labor acknowledges the disproport ionate impact of recent university funding changes on 
female students, as well as those from low socio -economic backgrounds and Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander students. Labor will properly support Australian universities.
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
37 
 
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE , ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  
1. Labor will ensure that Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower, harnessing our 
natural advantages in clean energy to become energy independent from the world  and a major 
clean energy exporter , whilst lowering power prices, reaching zero net emissions by 2050 and 
strengthening the future growth of Australian industry and jobs.  
2. Labor believes in a strong national environmental protection framework that strengthens our 
natural environment, reduces and manages waste, helps to prevent dangerous bushfires, 
secures cleaner air, protects our native species and habitat and builds our nation’s water 
security and biodiversity, in the face of increasingly frequent and severe drought.  
3. Labor supports the sustainable and responsible  use of our natural resources . Our nation must 
secure existing jobs and support the creation of new high paying jobs to prepare for our growing 
environmental and economic challenges.  
4. Labor understands that Australia’s wellbeing depends on a sustainable glo bal environment and 
that as a substantial power we can make a signiﬁcant contribution to international eﬀorts on 
climate change, biodiversity and waste management.  
5. As the first and enduring custodians of the land, oceans and rivers, First Nations 
peoples‘ authority, knowledge and experience is crucial to conserving nature and acting on 
climate change.  Working with First Nations peoples, modern science and traditional knowledge 
will together be instrumental in solving today’s environmental challenges . 
6. Science is always central to Labor’s decision -making in relation to climate change, energy and 
the environment.  
7. Labor recognises the strength and sustainability of our economy depends on the health of the 
environments in which we work, live and play, in wh ich clean water, air and healthy ecosystems 
are protected. We recognise a strong economy is underpinned by a healthy environment. We 
recognise the intrinsic value of nature and believe that each generation has a responsibility to 
engage in stewardship of t he natural environment . 
Creating a low -emissions economy  
8. Labor believes Australia’s future prosperity lies as  an energy superpower, built on our world 
class renewable energy resources and technical skills . We will develop and implement p ractical, 
collabora tive policies informed by the best science and consistent with the goals of the Paris 
Accord  to realise Australia’s huge  renewable energy opportunities and  ensure all Australians  
benefit  not only through stronger  economic growth but also access to more aff ordable  energy . 
9. Labor accepts the science of climate change . We accept that  human -induced climate change 
represents a massive risk to the world and that a llowing global temperatures to increase by 2 
degrees or more above pre -industrial levels will have devastating effects, especially on 
Australia . 
10. As a continent that encompasses hot, dry and tropical zones, and is home to unique ecosystems, 
Australia is  particularly  exposed to the damaging effects of climate change which makes the 
case for meaningful act ion even more urgent.  The longer we delay action, the greater the
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
38 
 
consequences of climate change . Labor understands delaying action on climate change places 
a larger burden on future generations . 
11. Labor believes First Nations people’s knowledge and experien ce of the land must be respected 
and should be employed to help Australia address climate change . We will ensure that First 
Nations people also benefit from the economic opportunities  that result from adapting and 
advancing the economy around climate chang e. 
12. Labor will take strong action to reduce the impact of climate change on Australia’s environment 
and take advantage of the economic opportunities of becoming a low pollution economy . 
Labor’s approach will be technologically agnostic and guided by the bes t science, engineering 
and economics . 
13. Labor will implement  a climate change and energy policy to reduce carbon pollution in line with 
the Paris Accord goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees above pre -industrial 
levels and taking efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees above pre -industrial levels . Labor 
acknowledges this will require Australia’s economy to reach net zero domestic greenhouse gas 
pollution by 2050  and deliver medium term targets consistent with that goal and the best 
available scientiﬁc and economic advice . 
14. Labor believes the  most effective and economically beneficial way to address climate change 
and deliver least cost abatement is to partner with industry, workers and communities to 
develop and implement plans and po licies that cut pollution, modernise the economy, reduce 
energy prices, deliver social and economic justice, and grow the jobs and industries of the 
future.  This means incentivising and supporting abatement of pollution in the industrial, mining 
and agricu ltural sectors, utilising the land sector to sequester carbon, supporting the adoption 
of new transport technologies and delivering a clean, affordable and modern energy system, 
including providing a supportive regulatory framework for the development of o ﬀshore 
renewable energy.  
15. Labor will maximise the jobs and industry growth from this modernisation of our economy and 
will ensure jobs in the clean economy provide security, good wages and conditions . 
16. Labor recognises a changing climate requires investment in natural and built infrastructure to 
protect our communities and help them adapt to new realities. Labor will provide national 
leadership to identify long term investments to improve the capacity of our urban and natural 
environments, our water supplies and food production to protect people and their health, adapt 
to change and create resilience.  
17. Labor recognises households and communities already facing existing stress or hardship, 
including those living on low or ﬁxed incomes, people with chronic health issues, people with a 
disability, and those facing ﬁnancial stress, can be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change such as increased heatwaves, extreme weather events and more intense and 
frequent bushﬁres. Furthermore, Labor recogn ises the importance of assisting these vulnerable 
communities (noting that women are more likely than men to live in poverty and do so for 
longer) to adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. In doing so, we can reduce their 
vulnerability and cre ate other beneﬁts including reducing ﬁnancial stress, improving housing 
quality, creating employment opportunities and building community resilience.  
18. Labor believes that the Commonwealth public sector should demonstrate active leadership on 
emissions reduc tion and sustainability. Therefore a Labor government will set a goal of
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
39 
 
achieving net zero emissions across the public service. Labor will work with public sector unions, 
public servants and other stakeholders to develop emissions reduction and sustainabi lity 
initiatives such as measuring and reporting on emissions across government, upgrading to 
cleaner sources of energy, cutting emissions from transport, changing work practices, improving 
the eﬃciency of buildings and land use, purchasing environmentally  friendly products, and 
reducing and recycling its waste.  
19. Labor will develop a national and cooperative approach to cutting transport sector emissions, 
including from passenger motor vehicles, freight, shipping and air. Labor will work with industry 
and ot her stakeholders around adoption of mandatory emissions standards for light passenger 
vehicles, and policy to support the take up of low or zero emissions vehicles, including 
infrastructure investment.  
20. Labor will pursue policies which will transform Austra lia’s established energy -intensive 
industrial sectors - such as aluminium and steel, as well as the industries of the future such as 
hydrogen production - so they become global leaders delivering significant jobs, investment and 
economic diversification and environmental sustainability . We will build on leading strategies 
from around the world and work with industry and research agencies to adapt our existing LPG 
pipeline infrastructure to help this industry grow.  
21. Supported by the advice of experts including the Chief Scientist and the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, Labor recognises the role that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will 
play in abating carbon pollution and ensuring industries like heavy man ufacturing and gas 
production are able to play their role in meeting carbon pollution reduction goals consistent 
with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Labor ’s support, to date,  for the development 
of CCS technologies stands in sharp contrast to the record of the Coalition government which 
has abolished CCS support programs and cut $460 million in CCS ﬁnancial support.  
22. Labor will work with unions and industry to ensure that the workers and communities affected 
by economic changes will prosper in a  modern energy economy.  
23. Labor recognises the Paris Agreement is more than just a commitment to emissions reductions 
and therefore commits to implementing all of the components of the Agreement including its 
requirement for just transition planning involvin g local communities, unions, and industry to be 
a key part of Australia ’s Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. A 
federal Labor Government will join Australia with the dozens of countries around the world 
developing plans consistent  with the Paris Agreement which requires a just transition of the 
workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally 
deﬁned development priorities.  
24. Labor recognises that the transformation underway in Australia’s  energ y industry is causing 
substantial industry restructuring that is impacting many energy industry workers and their 
communities. Labor also recognises the need to implement a new model of industry 
restructuring that is people -focused and ensures that the cos ts of change are not borne solely 
by workers and host communities .  
25. Labor will establish a statutory authority charged with mitigating the adverse impacts of coal 
power station closures on regional workforces and communities as a priority. The authority wi ll, 
as a minimum, have the power to implement job transfer schemes for workers in coal power 
stations and associated mines allowing for voluntary redundancy and redeployment
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
40 
 
opportunities to be shared across sites and the capacity to develop and implement economic 
development programs for impacted regions.  
26. The authority’s governance structure shall include major stakeholders including unions and 
industry and will work cooperatively and on a complementary basis with federal, state and local 
government bodies , charged with energy, climate and structural adjustment responsibilities. 
Over time, Labor will consider the case for the ambit of the authority to be extended to other 
industries undergoing major restructuring as they arise.  
27. Labor will ensure we stand re ady as a nation to adapt to the unavoidable  impacts of climate 
change . Based on science, we  will work with communities, industry, state, territory and local 
governments, to prepare for climate change impacts and ensure the costs of adaptation do not 
fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians . 
28. Labor will restore integrity  and independence to the environment and climate change portfolios 
and relevant science agencies . This will include improving the effectiveness of the  Climate 
Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy 
Agency . 
29. Labor will take a whole of government approach to climate risk disclosure in the public sector, 
as well as working with regulatory agencies, businesses,  unions and investor groups to ensure 
climate risk disclosure and management are at the centre of the modernisation of the economy . 
Climate change related financial and other risk in the public and private sector should be 
prudently managed and disclosed, consistent with meeting the goals of the Paris Accord . 
A national energy policy  
30. Labor will modernise Australia’s energy system and develop a framework that will ensure 
reliable, affordable and clean energy for families and businesses.  Labor will ensure sufficient 
investment in new generation to replace retiring assets, support the electriﬁcation of our 
transport infrastructure, and grow new industries such as green steel and green alumin ium, as 
well as ensure affordability, reliability and pollution reduction goals.  
31. We recognise  renewable energy as being central to our economic futur e and will ensure all 
Australians  have equal access to the benefits of energy efficiency and clean energy.  
32. Labor will end the Coalition’s national energy pol icy vacuum that has undermined our energy 
affordability  and security and obstructed the expansion of clean energy . We will implement 
policies to modernise our energy markets and institutions, rejuvenate our energy infrastructure 
and secure reliable energy . 
33. Community and publicly -owned energy systems will play a critical role in the modernisation of 
Australia ’s energy system, including in regional and remote communities. Labor will support the 
ongoing development and deployment of community and publicly -owned energy systems, 
ensuring all Australians can access the economic and environmental beneﬁts of renewable 
energy.  
34. Labor recognises and supports the critical role that gas plays in the Australian economy. Labor 
recognises that gas has an import ant role to play in achieving Labor ’s target of net zero 
emissions by 2050. Labor ’s policies will support Australian workers in the gas extraction 
industry, building on Labor ’s legacy of supporting suﬃcient and aﬀordable gas supply for
CHAPTER 3 : CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
41 
 
Australian industry and consumers. This includes support for new gas projects and associated 
infrastructure, subject to independent approval processes to ensure legitimate community 
concerns are heard and addressed. Labor will ensure the industry assesses and manages 
environm ental and other impacts, including on water reserves and co -existence with other 
agricultural activities, and engages constructively with landholders.  The Federal government 
must also institute policies like more rigorous use -it or lose -it conditions for o ﬀshore gas 
resources, a price related export control trigger, and domestic reservation policies to ensure 
environmentally approved gas projects are developed for the beneﬁt of Australians, including 
as a feedstock to crucial strategic manufacturing industr ies including chemical and fertiliser 
production.  Labor recognises the critical role gas -power generation plays in ﬁrming the National 
Electricity Market (NEM) and will have regard to the advice of the Australian Energy Market 
Operator (AEMO) in continuing  to ensure reliability and price aﬀordability as the NEM 
transitions to net zero emissions and as other technologies emerge.  
35. Working with industry, workers and states, Labor will ensure access to affordable gas to support 
Australian households, power gener ation and industry, including through measures desig ned 
to ensure Australia’s energy security . 
36. Labor will work with state and territory governments, industry and unions on a strategic 
national approach to the future development of our energy system, includ ing transmission and 
distribution planning and investment and supporting the development of Renewable Energy 
Zones.  
37. Labor  will ensure Australian  consumers are the focus of energy sector reform, including through 
strong consumer protections to  encourage ret ailers to  keep energy costs down.  Electricity is an 
essential service and high electricity prices are a ﬁrst order cost of living issue for millions of 
households and businesses across the nation. An overemphasis on privatisation and 
deregulation in the en ergy sector ahead of the interests of consumers has contributed to high 
electricity prices, especially for the most vulnerable members of the community.   
38. Labor will ensure energy sector reform incorporates strong worker protections to avoid 
reductions in maintenance standards, safety, quality and reliability of energy systems.  
39. Labor will support the development of new low pollution forms of energy, including traditional 
and new renewable energy, clean hydrogen, bioenergy, as well as supportin g industrial and 
research capacity . 
40. Australia’s national and economic security rests on its ability to supply critical products and 
services to the nation, particularly during global disruptions to supply chains and markets . 
Whilst the COVID -19 pandemic ha s served as a stark reminder of this fact, the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) has warned for many years that Australia’s grossly inadequate liquid fuel 
reserves undermine its national security and economic resilience . Australia is one of the only 
develo ped countries in the world that does not consistently meet the 90 -day requirement for 
domestic fuel storage . Labor will secure Australia’s fuel security and ensure Australia meets its 
IEA obligations , including by ensuring a robust domestic fuel refining a nd storage capability.  
Stronger environmental protections  
41. Labor recognises the strength and sustainability of our economy depends on the health of the 
environments in which we work, live and play, in which clean water, air and healthy ecosystems 
are protec ted. We recognise a strong economy is underpinned by a healthy environment. We
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
42 
 
recognise the intrinsic value of nature and believe that each generation has a responsibility to 
engage in stewardship of the natural environment.   
42. Australia ’s natural environme nt and iconic places are in an overall state of decline and are under 
increasing threat. The current environmental trajectory is unsustainable. The globe is facing an 
extinction crisis, and Australia has one of the worst records of extinctions on earth. Re cent 
experiences of drought and catastrophic ﬁre reveal the human cost of environmental decline 
and its impacts on the economy. Labor is committed to addressing the environmental crisis, 
while also building sustainable jobs and an economy that builds prosp erous regions . 
43. Australia ’s Indigenous culture s are the oldest continuous culture s on earth. Labor is committed 
to eﬀective protection of First Nations cultural heritage.  
44. Labor believes in the importance of protecting our nation ’s built heritage, for its own intrinsic 
value and because of the longer -term conservation beneﬁts that arise from re -purposing and 
reuse.  
Environmental governance, management and international obligations   
45. Labor will ensure the Commonwealth has the institutional capacity to provide eﬀective and 
transparent environmental management systems, which are essenti al for sound decision -
making, monitoring, assessment and reporting of environmental performance and outcomes. 
That will include an Environment Protection Agency: a strong cop on the beat that is genuinely 
independent of the government, will report to the P arliament, and will play a central role in 
restoring Australians trust in the Commonwealth ’s capacity and willingness to protect our 
precious natural environment .  
46. Labor is committed to making sure that Australia meets its responsibilities under internatio nal 
environmental treaties including the World Heritage Convention, the Convention on 
Biodiversity and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands . Labor believes that the Commonwealth 
must always retain the right to be the final decision -maker on projects that affe ct matters of 
national environmental significance.  
47. Labor will act to arrest species loss, protect habitats, control invasive species, support 
sustainable development, protect biodiversity, protect heritage, restore landscapes, control 
plastic pollution, im prove air quality and water quality, and restore natural capital.  
48. Labor will reform Australia’s  environmental protection laws to ensure they are fit-for-purpose  
to arrest environmental decline and restore environmental health , which means they must 
provide for:  
a. a central voice for First Nations people in the design of environment protection laws, 
programs and policies;  
b. efficient , streamlined  and effective environmental assessment processes;  
c. the fair , efficient and effective management of Australia’s environment and biodiversity 
as a foundation for ecologically, socially and economically sustainable jobs;  
d. biodiversity conservation, resilience in the natural environment, restoration and recovery, 
and ecological sustainability; and
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
43 
 
e. the creation of strong , legally enforceable National Environmental Standards, supported 
by robust data, that act to maintain or improve the environment . 
49. Noting the scientiﬁc evidence of the link between biodiversity mismanagement and pandemics, 
Labor will play an active role in ternationally on biodiversity conservation including through 
multilateral and regional organisations and bilateral support for countries in our region.   
First Nations and heritage  
50. Labor recognises  the deep  trauma  caused  to First  Nations  peoples  from  the destruction  of their  
spiritual,  cultural, and physical  heritage .  
51. Labor will assert the strong national interest in valuing and protecting First Nations spiritual, 
cultural, and physical heritage as the embodiment of the oldest continuous culture on earth,  
and as an essential part of our national identity.  
52. Labor will work with First Nations people and states and territories to create an eﬀective 
national framework for protecting First Nations heritage, including the adoption of minimum 
national standards, improved Commonwealth mechanisms for heritage listing and emergency 
protection, and proper keeper protocols consistent with Australia’s  international obligations, 
and built on the foundation of free, prior, and informed consent.  
53. Labor will : 
a. work with Trad itional Owners as well as the states and territories to create better 
governance structures and management programs for Commonwealth properties of 
heritage signiﬁcance ; 
b. support the investigation and nomination of areas suitable for future listing led by 
Traditional Owners in cooperation with state and territory governments and other 
stakeholders, and support Traditional Owners to pursue World Heritage listing for the 
Kimberley ; 
c. support Traditional Owners to pursue resolution of outstanding Cape York tenure issues 
and, if consent is granted, subsequently pursue World Heritage listing for appropriate 
areas of Cape York, recognising the importance of federal leadership and the consent of 
Traditional Owners  
d. work with Traditional Owners as well as the states and territories to create better  
governance structures and mana gement pro grams for Commonwealth properties of 
herita ge signiﬁcance;  
e. ensure cultural  values are included in all National and World Heritage listings ; 
f. oppose resource extraction in national parks or World Heritage areas ; and  
g. ensure environmental laws are fully applied to protect World Heritage sites from the 
construction of dams or the raising of dam  walls that would inundate those sites.  
The Great Barrier Reef  
54. Labor recognises the significance of sites like the G reat Barrier Reef . It is part of Australia’s 
national identity . We believe a  healthy Reef is not just a key part of our  culture  and
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
44 
 
environm ent, but its health also is critical to our  economy —supporting thousands of jobs in the 
tourism industry . Labor will protect the Great Barrier Reef by : 
a. addressing climate change;  
b. increasing ocean protection in the Coral Sea;  
c. improving water quality  includi ng through assisting communities to adapt and apply 
scientific advice ; 
d. strengthening our environmental laws  and institutional capacity ; and  
e. safeguarding the biodiversity of species and ecological habitats in its catchments.  
Parks and reserves, and caring for landscapes and waterways  
55. Acknowledging that protected areas are fundamental to biodiversity protection, Australia 
needs an extensive, eﬀectively -managed national system of parks and reserves, as well as 
policies aimed at achieving ecologically s ustainable use of other land and waterways.   
56. Labor will ensure national environment funding programs and other volunteer and community 
programs, like Landcare  funding , support local sustainable agriculture, soil management, 
conservation and environmental p riorities and contribute to national priorities to improve 
biodiversity and resilience . 
57. Labor shares the passion of local environment conservation and health groups. Grassroots 
volunteers are members of their local communities, who live and work alongside those working 
in the natural resource industries. Their eﬀorts should never be used to displace paid and 
productive employment, or to substitute for what are rightly governmental responsibilities. 
Local volunteers can play an important role in mobilising g overnment and community action on 
local environmental issues, and their contribution to protecting and preserving Australia’s  
environment, and the wellbeing of Australians, is invaluable . 
58. Labor will address environmental and climate change impacts of land clearing in the nations 
environmental laws in order to address biodiversity loss and climate change. As part of a 
comprehensive plan to build a carbon sink of scale and size, Labor will cooperate with the states, 
territories, local government and landholde rs to achieve a net increase in Australia’s  vegetation 
cover to improve its management and to end broad -scale clearing, including through 
conditional funding. Labor will implement a best practice national vegetation mapping and 
monitoring program to suppor t these aims. In doing so Labor will consult broadly with 
stakeholders . 
59. Labor will act to protect Australians, our landscapes and animals from the impacts of increasing 
severe weather events, including ﬁre and ﬂoods. Labor will respond to the scale of this  threat 
with national coordination and cutting - edge science and management responses.  
60. Labor is committed to building Australia’s  land - and ocean -based carbon oﬀsets industry. It is a 
powerful way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create economic opportunity, especially 
in rural and regional Australia. It can also help protect and restore Australia’s  natural land scapes  
and seas capes . 
61. Labor supports Landcare and promotes sustainable farming practices and improved natural 
resource management .
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
45 
 
62. Labor will:  
a. support programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to work on and manage 
country that support jobs, particularly  through considering expanding long -term funding 
of and recognition for the highly successful Indigenous Ranger and Indigenous Protected 
Area programs ; 
b. support new opportunities for First Nations people, particularly in remote and regional 
communities, to participate in a low carbon economy through initiatives such as carbon 
farming;  
c. support Australians who live in remote communities reliant on diesel fuel for electricity, 
including First Nations people, to access renewable alternatives such as solar; and  
d. encourage First Nations people -co-management of  land  and sea scapes , including 
through national parks, tourism and state forests.  
63. Labor will harness  the social, economic and environmental benefits that flow from the 
sustainable management of Australia’s fo rests.  
64. Labor  will continue to work with industry, unions, communities and environmentalists in 
relation to Tasmanian forests and the forestry industry.  
65. Labor will support internationally recognised forest certification with robust governance 
arrangements w hich set best practice, transparent, consistent and objective standards in 
sustainable forest management, chain of custody and labelling . Labor will require employers in 
the industry to uphold , acknowledge, respect, sustain and support the principles and rights at 
work as defined by the ILO . 
66. International forest certification schemes operating in Australia will be required to have 
workers' representatives on their global and Australian governing  boards nominated by the 
International Trade Union Confederation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions 
respectively . 
Wildlife trade  
67. In line with international obligations, Labor will support the survival of iconic species by working 
with the states to  ban Australia's domestic trade in endangered animals such as the trade of 
ivory and rhinoceros horn, noting the need for carefully targeted exemptions for items which 
do not contribute to poaching . Labor will act against unacceptable risks of animal cruel ty, such 
as illegal import or export of shark fins or shark finning  or lion trophies. We will improve the 
regulation of wildlife trade to ensure it causes no detriment to species, and where possible 
delivers conservation beneﬁts . 
Reducing waste, building a circular economy and reducing pollution  
68. Labor will lead a shift towards a circular economy that reduces waste and pollution while 
creating new productive opportunities and  jobs.   
69. Labor  will work  to ensure  that our nation  and its people  reduce  the use of resources,  reuse  and 
recycle  material wherever possible, and responsibly dispose of any  residue.
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
46 
 
70. Labor will work with states and territories, local governments, the resource management 
sector, industry, and the broader community to ensur e National Waste Policy objectives are 
monitored, reviewed, and achieved through focused measures in the key areas of producer 
responsibility, product stewardship, material standards and innovative design, labelling, 
recycling infrastructure, government pr ocurement, the elimination of unnecessary and harmful 
products, and consumer  awareness.   
71. Labor will promote international cooperation to reduce waste and pollution, particularly with 
respect to ocean plastic, and particularly in our region. We support eﬀor ts to negotiate a treaty 
on marine litter and microplastics.  
72. Labor will develop a national framework for a circular economy, aiming to close the loop by 
minimising waste - generation and increasing the use of and extending the life of recyclable  
resources.   
73. Labor will enforce tough controls on pollutants and toxins in the environment, minimise the 
production, import and use of harmful substances, develop alternative technologies and, where 
possible, eliminate harmful substances.  
74. Labor will fulﬁl Australia’ s obligations to control the safe movement of hazardous waste.  
75. Labor will promote national air quality standards and monitoring, reporting and control of air 
pollution.  
Water, rivers, oceans and coasts  
76. Australia ’s long -term  water  issues  require  national  leadership . Labor  will lead  responsible  
management  of water assets by acting on climate change, promoting wise water usage, 
securing adequate water supplies, and supporting healthy rivers. Labor will consider expanding 
the protections provided by the current water trigger in Federal environment  law. 
77. Labor wants the Murray -Darling Basin to have healthy, working rivers, supporting agriculture 
including food production, sustaining local communities, allowing for First Nations cultural 
practices, and p roviding a haven for the abundant plants and wildlife that depend on the  
system.  
78. Labor believes in maintaining a strong leadership role for the Commonwealth in relation to the 
Murray -Darling Basin, to ensure trust and conﬁdence in the governance and manage ment of 
water. We recognise that matters such as the Menindee ﬁsh kill, concerns about water scarcity, 
and the Liberals and Nationals failures of leadership have undermined conﬁdence in water 
governance and management. Labor believes that trust and conﬁden ce must be restored.  
79. Labor  will address  the long -term  problems  of over -allocation  of the water  resources  of the 
Murray -Darling  Basin and the neglect of the health of its iconic rivers and wetlands. We will 
ensure science is at the heart of decision - making , informed by First Nations people alongside 
other local knowledge and  experience.  
80. Labor  will take a rigorous approach to compliance and hold the states to account in relation to 
their management of water. We will seek arrangements in which decisions are m ade 
transparently, and breaches of the law are acted on. Labor will continuously seek to update and 
increase the body of knowledge underpinning the Murray -Darling Basin Plan, noting that
CHAPTER 3: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT   
     
 
47 
 
climate change is exacerbating the problems facing the Murray -Darling  Basin and other river 
systems.  
81. Labor will protect the ecological health of the rivers, ﬂoodplains, wetlands, lakes and channels 
of the Lake Eyre Basin and will cooperate with the governments of the Northern Territory, South 
Australia, Queensland and N ew S outh Wales to protect the ecological sustainability of the Basin.  
82. Labor will support initiatives to improve water security for Australia ’s cities and towns including 
by ensuring that residential, agricultural and industrial water use is sustainable, suppor ting 
eﬃcient water infrastructure, and by supporting investment in alternative water supply options 
such as wastewater recycling, desalination, and stormwater harvesting. Labor will ensure 
economic developments are stringently assessed for their eﬀect on w ater quality and supply, 
having regard to the impacts on species and the eﬀects of climate change.  
83. Labor will continue its proud record of protecting Australia ’s oceans, including the Whitlam 
Government ’s establishment of the nation’s  ﬁrst marine reserve to protect the Great Barrier 
Reef, and the Rudd and Gillard Governments ’ establishment of Australia’s  Marine Reserve 
Network, which was, at the time, the largest network of marine protected areas anywhere in 
the world.  
84. Labor will:  
a. work to ensure Australia' s bioregional plans and marine parks network are science -based, 
reviewed in a timely manner, meet standards for protected areas, and bring social, 
cultural and economic beneﬁts to local communities;  
b. protect Australia’s unique marine environments, tourism industry, valued ﬁshing industry 
and recreational ﬁshing lifestyle from the risks of overﬁshing and from the use of super 
trawlers, unless a thorough assessment against the science can verify operatio ns will not 
undermine small pelagic ﬁsheries and recreational ﬁshing spots;  
c. ensure protection, based on scientiﬁc advice, for iconic marine species like whales, 
dugongs, turtles and sharks, and promote the conservation and research of key 
bioregional heal th indicator species;  
d. support protections against and responses to coastal erosion, and support coastal 
communities.
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
48 
 
CHAPTER 4:  A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY  
1. Labor seeks to achieve  opportunity for all . Our nation’s prosperity should be shared fairly and 
every Australian should have the chance to realise their talents and succeed in the world.  
2. Inclusion and prosperity are interdependent . When  any one of us is left behind, we are all the 
poorer for it . Our future prosperity is dependent on a strong safety net that ensures every 
Australian has the opportunity to contribute to our economy and community.  
3. Labor will not abandon people when they fall on hard times.  We seek to build on more than a 
century of  Labo r reforms, which help people and families rebound from misfortune.  
Unemployment payments, Medicare, workers’ compensation, transport accident insurance and 
the NDIS  all insulate Australians from circumstances  that are beyond their control . 
4. By ensuring peop le receive the support they need when they need it, Australians are better 
placed to pursue their longer -term interests and in doing so , bring greater benefit to themselves 
and our community.  
Health: equity, access and reform   
5. Labor believes all Australian s have a right to the best possible health, including affordable and 
accessible care when and where they need it . It is why we created Medicare and have remained 
its unwavering champion for nearly half a century in the face of repeated Coalition attempts to 
dismantle or undermine it . The Australian people know that only Labor can be trusted to keep 
our health system strong and universal . 
6. Recent times have seen the emergence of major challenges for our health system . Even before 
the COVID -19 pandem ic, Australians faced stubborn health inequalities, record costs , record  
waits for care, and stalled reform – all exacerbated by the Coalitions’ cuts and neglect . Labor 
believes that n ow is the moment to strengthen our health system to meet the demands of the 
future —because a healthier country means a stronger economy and a better society . Labor’s  
three priorities for Australia’s health system are therefore equity, access and reform.  
Equity: Giving every Australian a fair shot at a healthy life  
7. As the party  of equality, Labor does not accept  that your health  outcomes  and life expectancy 
should be determined by your wealth, class or background . We know that the more equal a 
society is, the better its overall standard of health is likely to be . Unfortunately, in some 
countries, the life expectancy of working people is going backwards —we will never accept this  
in Australia  and will do everything we can to ensure health outcomes  improve for all Australians.  
Labor understands that health outcomes are only partly d etermined by access to health care 
and are also driven by social determinants such as education, employment and housing.  This 
understanding of the social determinants of health will be at the centre of all our policies . 
8. We know that lifestyle is a powerful  determinant of people’s health . Labor will therefore 
support policies that promote wellness and prevent disease – for every Australian, including the 
poorest Australians . Australians deserve the best possible environments and  support to 
improve their life styles, including through exercise, better diets, preventing and giving up 
smoking and reducing harmful use of alcohol and drugs .
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
49 
 
9. Living healthier lives will reduce the incidence of chronic disease, which is one of the greatest 
threats to Australia’s healt h and health system . We will support and encourage evidence -based 
health promotion and education, including through helping people better prevent and manage 
chronic conditions . We will also invest in programs and research that furthers our ability to 
preve nt and manage chronic disease . 
10. Labor recognises addiction as a chronic health condition. Labor believes that aﬀordable 
treatment services for addiction, including of alcohol and other drugs and gambling, are 
important to achieving a healthy and inclusive society. Labor is committed to harm minimisation 
principles in the management of addiction. Labor understands the importance of prevention, 
public awareness, and community -based services as part of a suite of policies critical to ensuring 
that pe ople can seek help quickly and in the most appropriate setting. Labor will support 
addiction workforces, recognising this will divert pressure from the mental health workforces, 
emergency departments, ﬁrst responders, and other health and social care servi ces. 
11. Families have a major role to play in encouraging good health, especially in children . We will 
work with families to help give children the best possible start in life, including by improving 
access to pre -pregnancy care, encouraging healthy habits, r educing obesity and promoting 
physical activity.  
12. The World Health Organisation says that climate change is the defining health issue of the 21 st 
Century . It poses a major danger to public health, with bushfires, floods and the steady southern 
creep of tropical diseases . Already  these are all  affecting the physical and ment al health of many 
Australians, particularly those in regional areas . Labor will treat climate and health as a major 
National Health P riority . 
13. Labor is committed to Clos ing the Gap in h ealth for First Nations people. Our policies will 
recognise the successes achieved by First Nations people -led health and related services. Labor 
will work in partnership with First Nations people and community -controlled health 
organisations to reduce the  gross inequalities in health outcomes between First Nations people 
and other Australians.  We will work to address institutional and interpersonal racism and 
ensure the entire health system is equipped to provide eﬀective and culturally safe health care 
to First Nations people. This includes increasing the numbers of First Nations people in all parts 
of the health workforce.   
14. Labor know s that Australians who live outside our capital cities do not get the same access to 
health  and mental health care and that  this contributes to vast health inequalities.  We will 
improve access to health services throughout regional, rural and remote Australia, including by 
improving incentives for health providers to practice in the bush, and supporting new models 
such as rura l generalist pathways.  Where in -person services are not available, we will work to 
better connect people in regional, rural and remote Australia to world -class care, including 
through telehealth , which should be extended beyond the pandemic . 
15. Labor celebrat es multiculturalism and a diverse society. Labor acknowledges that CALD 
communities often have language and cultural barriers in seeking or accessing health services. 
Labor commits to providing equitable access to health services to our CALD communities th at 
are culturally and linguistically accessible.

Access: helping Australians access affordable care when and where they need it  
16. Labor governments have upheld the promise  of universal access to health care , including by 
establishing  Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and by striking landmark public 
hospital agreements when last in Government . After three terms of Coalition cuts and neglect, 
Australians face record costs and waits for care, forcing millions to skip vital  services . Labor will 
work to restore universal access to health care in Australia.  
17. General practice is the first port of call for sick Australians . GPs work alongside a range of other 
vital primary and community health providers, including nurses, pharmac ists, allied health 
practitioners, Aboriginal health providers and others .  Labor will work to ensure the affordability 
of primary care, including  maintaining  GP bulk -billing  and Medicare access for other providers . 
Labor will also support efforts to impro ve the quality and coordination of primary care, and will 
particularly encourage new models of care that better prevent and manage chronic disease.  
18.  Labor sees oral health as the missing element of Medicare. Our goal is to provide universal 
access to aﬀord able  dental services for all Australians, and an elected Labor Government will 
engage a consultative process with all relevant stakeholders to begin this work.  
19. Labor will make the mental health of all Australians a national priority. Labor will work with the 
states and territories and will invest in an integrated, cross -sector and whole of government 
mental health care system that is based on evidence and centred on early intervention. Labor 
will work to break down the stigma around mental ill health,  encourage people to seek help and 
make sure mental health services are better coordinated, aﬀordable, culturally and linguistically 
relevant, and reach the most disadvantaged and at -risk groups. These include older people, 
young people, people from non -English speaking backgrounds , LGBTIQ+  and Indigenous 
Australians , as well as people with experiences of poverty, trauma, marginalisation and 
discrimination . Labor will also invest in research and evidence -based services to help reduce 
Australia’s  unacceptabl y high suicide rate and make doing so a national priority.  
20. Labor is also concerned by the Coalition’s record of delayed and denied PBS listings, and by the 
number of Australians who are unable to afford medicines even when they are listed on the 
PBS. Labor  will protect and strengthen the PBS to ensure all Australians get aﬀordable and 
timely access to essential medicines. We will ensure that any proposed international treaties 
do not undermine equitable access to medicines.  
21. From time to time, all Australians require specialist services, either in the community (such as 
pathology and diagnostic imaging) or a hospital ( such as outpatient services and surgery) . Long 
waits for public services and high costs for private services have become major barrie rs to 
accessing care under the Coalition . Labor will work to improve the affordability and timeliness 
of specialist care, including by empowering consumers to make informed choices between 
providers, and by working with the states  and territories  to reduce  waiting times for outpatient 
services and emergency department care . Labor will also work to improve coordination across 
other health and aged care services to improve care and reduce unwarranted hospital 
admissions and readmissions.  
22. Labor r ecognise s that both public and private sectors play critical roles in Australia’s world -class 
health system . We are concerned that Australians are abandoning private health insurance due 
to increasing costs a nd declining value . While governments have sole responsibility  for
health system . We are concerned that Australians are abandoning private health insurance due 
to increasing costs a nd declining value . While governments have sole responsibility  for 
managing the public health system, they also support a strong and sustainable private health 
care system .
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
51 
 
23. Labor will work to improve sexual and reproductive health for all Australians. Labor will ensure 
that whether people choose to continue with preg nancy or not, they are supported by access 
to relevant medical, support and advice services. Labor undertakes to address the underlying 
factors which act to limit genuine choice and commits to expanding access to sexual and 
reproductive health care includi ng contraception and termination as well as pregnancy and 
postnatal care, general health care, aﬀordable housing, child care, education, secure work and 
ﬁnancial support, along with medical advice and other support services, to that end.  
24. Every Australian d eserves the highest quality palliative care. Palliative care reﬂects the long -
held belief that when every reasonable eﬀort to restore health has been exhausted, pain should 
be relieved,  and quality of life should be prioritised. Labor commits to working wi th the states 
and territories to ensure excellent palliative care options for all Australians.  
25. Every Australian also deserves the highest quality end -of-life care in their ﬁnal days. This 
requires a health policy discussion at the State and Territory leve l to determine whether current 
end-of-life care practice reﬂects the community’s  preferences not only about where they wish 
to die, but when to die. Labor recognises that some states have legislated in this regard. We 
also recognise that current Commonweal th legislation acts as an impediment for the territories 
to legislate in respect to these issues.  
Reform: Improving Australia’s healthcare system for the future  
26. Australia’s  health system is complex and requires constant improvement to meet new 
challenges . It must be resourced and ready to cope with the challenges of the future —some  of 
which are predictable, such as the rise in chronic disease and mental ill health, and some of 
which are unexpected, such as the COVID -19 pandemic . This will require not just investment, 
but a smarter and more holistic approach to health care provision . Labor  will look for 
opportunities to break down the silos across all levels of the health, aged care and disability 
systems to improve physical, mental and social health an d wellbeing . 
27. Labor will work with patients and the health workforce to place the patient at the centre of 
care . We will create more opportunities for consumers, health care professionals and other key 
participants to help improve our health care system . 
28. Labor will better harness technology to improve the delivery and coordination of care, reduce 
duplication and ensure better health outcomes for Australians . We believe technology should  
play a more central role in allowing patients to interact with their hea lth care providers, and 
Medicare requires reform to properly remunerate best practice . We will also continue  to build 
and integrate the digital health record system while protecting the data and privacy of 
Australian consumers . 
29. Labor  will invest in health and medical research and its translation into practice to ensure 
Australia’s  entire health system is prepared for current and future challenges . We will support 
the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Medical Research Future Fund, with 
a stronger focus on quality, independence and integrity . Labor  will enhance Australia’s 
reputation as a world leader in high quality, innovative medical and health research and 
development . Labor will support research led by First Nations people to improve he althcare 
outcomes.  
30. Labor  will enforce the ban on the cloning of human beings .
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
52 
 
31. Labor will ensure there is an appropriate supply and distribution of health professionals in all 
parts of our country, so all Australians get the health care they need where they  need it . We 
will restore a national approach to health workforce planning . Labor  will also support the 
physical and mental health of our health workforce and ensure their personal safety at work is 
a priority across the entire health system . 
32. Labor  believe s Australians value transparency and accountability in health . We will work to 
ensure data is reported in a transparent and nationally consistent manner and Australians get 
the information they need to make informed choices about their health care.  
33. Labor has a proud  record  on HIV. In the 1980s  the Hawke  Labor  Government  led the world  with  
its response  to the HIV epidemic. That response was underpinned by the enduring principles of 
partnership, harm reduction and non -partisanship. Disinvestment and policy neglect by the 
Coalition Government has seen Australia miss its target to eliminate HIV transmission by 2020. 
Labor commits to the UN Political Declaration on HIV & AIDS and will renew the eﬀort to make 
HIV history . 
Nurturing our c hildren  
34. Children are our nation’s future and Labor believes families deserve strong backing to nurture 
and educate the next generation . We will provide targeted financial support and programs that 
help them raise their children and achieve a good balance b etween work and family life, 
including Paid Parental Leave and Dad and Partner Pay.  
35. Labor understands that in order to have the best start in life, children need resilient, happy, 
loving families and communities . We will work to protect children at risk fr om disadvantage, 
neglect and abuse . We will seek to reduce the number of Australian children living in poverty.  
36. Labor will work in partnership with First Nations people  and their organisations to address the 
unacceptable overrepresentation of First Nations  children in Australia’s child protection system  
and ensure children in care maintain contact with their culture, language and community . 
37. Labor understands that the first thousand days of a child’s life forms the building blocks of their 
future . Labor will support families at this critical time through place based integrated health, 
education and family support services . For families that need extra assistance, we will invest in 
high quality early intervention and family support services . 
38. Labor will con tinue to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into 
Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to ensure institutional abuse of children cannot 
happen on this scale again . This includes implementing the National Redress Scheme in a way 
that puts the interest of survivors of institutional child sexual abuse first . 
39. Australia must respect and understand the experiences of past adoption practices . Labor will 
work with the states and territories to develop a uniform national system for adoptio n. These 
will prioritise the best interests of the child and ensure adequate safeguards against child 
trafficking.  
40. Labor will work to protect children from exposure to inappropriate material over the internet, 
at home, school and at other public access poi nts.
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
53 
 
41. Labor acknowledges the advocacy of survivors of child sexual abuse and will continue to work 
with survivors and  advocates to build community knowledge and support primary prevention. 
This includes strengthening community awareness of grooming, and how  to identify and report 
it. 
42. Organisations that work with children and vulnerable Australians must be held to consistent, 
harmonized safeguarding standards. For organisations that are registered with any state, 
territory or Commonwealth regulator, it should  be a condition of ongoing registration that they 
meet these standards.  
43. Labor believes all people should be able to access assisted reproductive technology, to adopt, 
and to enter into lawful surrogacy arrangements in Australia, regardless of relationship status, 
sex, gender, identity or sexual orientation.   
Valuing older Australians  
44. Labor believes older Australians should be valued and respected; they also deserve dignity, 
security and choice as they age . Australia’s ageing population is a social and econo mic asset that 
should be celebrated,  and Labor will develop a positive ageing strategy to benefit our 
community.  
45. Labor values the contribution of grandparents raising grandchildren and the work they do to 
protect and support vulnerable children. Labor will work with states and territories to make it 
easier for grandparents to access social security, ﬁnancial and the other supports to help with 
the care of their grandchildren.  
46. Labor believes that after long lives of working and providing for their famili es and contributing 
to their nation, older Australians deserve a fulfilling and secure retirement.  
47. Labor created the pension and we have protected it for 100 years. Labor built universal 
superannuation. We will always ensure Australia’s  post -retirement inc ome system is strong and 
sustainable, giving older Australians the ﬁnancial support and security they deserve.  
48. Older Australians in physically demanding jobs, those working in industries in transition, and 
those experiencing unemployment and underemploymen t before they are eligible for the Age 
Pension age are likely to have depleted ﬁnancial resources going into retirement. Labor will 
protect their right to a digniﬁed retirement.  
49. Labor  believe s that regardless of age, all Australians make important contribu tions to our 
community and our economy . We will remove barriers to those older Australians who choose 
to continue working and will provide better and more flexible work environments for older 
Australians, including addressing the growing problem of age dis crimination . 
50. All Australians deserve to be safe, particularly in their older years . Labor  will address the 
growing prevalence of elder abuse and neglect to keep older Australians free of the fear of 
physical, psychological, emotional, sexual or financial a buse.
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
54 
 
High quality a ged care services  
51. Labor believes that nobody should be denied access to high quality aged care services. Older 
Australians must be provided access to safe, person -centred and holistic care that is appropriate 
to individual needs, whethe r it is being provided in the community, home or a residential  facility.  
52. Labor recognises that the Australian aged care system is currently in crisis. Labor acknowledges 
the work of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Labor will work to  ensure 
that the sector is reformed in a coordinated and comprehensive manner, with the principles of 
quality, safety, dignity and fairness embedded at every level. As such, a Labor government will 
begin implementation of the recommendations in the Royal C ommissions ﬁnal report within 
the ﬁrst term of  oﬃce.  
53. As Australians get older, they should be able to easily navigate and choose the support and care 
arrangements they want. Labor will work to further ensure older Australians are able to align 
services wit h their needs and choices. To make informed choices, older Australians need access 
to information about the quality, accreditation and regulation of service providers. Labor will 
ensure that information and data on safety and quality standards of care is m ade readily 
available to older Australians and the community. Labor will improve the aged care regulation 
and accreditation system by ensuring older Australians - whether at home or in residential 
facilities their families, loved ones and the workforce can  safely provide feedback, including in 
a strong and robust complaints  system.  
54. Aged care funding needs to be sustainable and based on the needs of an ageing population. 
Labor will work with unions and key stakeholders to implement a model of funding that be tter 
addresses the needs of the people it supports, with a focus on improved care quality, mandated 
minimum staﬃng,  sustainability and transparency. Every dollar spent in aged care should go 
towards ensuring the provision of high quality and safe care. Lab or will ensure ﬁnancial 
transparency and accountability across the aged care sector, particularly for taxpayer funds 
invested in aged care  services.  
55. Labor recognises that many older Australians want to live independently in their homes for as 
long as possible. Labor recognises that the home care system is not currently meeting the needs 
of older Australians and people are left waiting for care, too often with tragic outcomes. Labor 
supports the delivery of high -quality home and community care services as and when they are 
needed by older  Australians.  
56. Labor will support high -quality aged care services being available in local communities, 
particularly in rural, regional and remote areas. Labor will make sure that the supply of high -
quality aged care serv ices meets current and future demand. Labor will work with local 
governments providing high -quality home and community care to ensure that these 
arrangements continue and there are no disruptions to care currently being  provided.  
57. Labor recognises the invaluable work of the aged care workforce in providing high  quality care 
and support to older Australians. The aged care workforce has been undervalued and under -
resourced for too long. Aged care workers deserve to have their skills recognised through 
appropriate wages and secure employment. Workers deserve to be supported through ongoing, 
meaningful training and career development. In recognition of our ageing population and the 
importance of this industry to the nation’s  future, Labor will invest in aged  care as an attractive, 
stable and well -paid career.
CHAPTER 4: A ST RONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
55 
 
58. Older Australians deserve care that accommodates their clinical, social and emotional needs. 
Aged care workers, across all occupation groups, must be provided with training and 
qualiﬁcations that equip t hem to manage specialist and  complex  care  proﬁles,  including  
dementia,  mental  health,  wound  management,  and infection  control.  Labor  will ensure 
providers support their workers to attain qualiﬁcations, receive comprehensive training and 
engage in Continued  Professional Development.  
59. Labor recognises the direct link between high -quality, safe care and workforce planning 
practices. Safe staﬃng levels ensure workers have enough time to provide holistic care, and this 
improves health and social outcomes for ever yone. Labor supports the implementation of 
recommended staﬃng models that increase minutes of care across occupation groups, to the 
best practice standards possible. We will ensure the regulation and accreditation of providers 
is linked to safe workforce p lanning practices. Labor will work with industry stakeholders, 
including unions, to review staﬃng models and ensure they are regularly revised and adapted 
as and when care needs increase or change.  
60. Labor recognises the role that information and communicati on technology can play in 
supporting older Australians to stay connected with loved ones and community, particularly 
during times where traditional access is not  possible.  
61. Labor will ensure the provision of culturally appropriate aged care, including strategies that 
address the particular needs of diverse groups of Australians  and First Nations people . Labor 
will ensure representatives from diverse communities are engaged at every level of reform to 
the aged care sector, to ensure services pr ovided are appropriate and their needs are  met.  
62. Labor will help the growing number of Australians living with dementia. We believe dementia 
should not be considered a normal part of ageing, but rather a terminal condition with major 
implications for our wh ole society. We believe that Australians living with dementia should have 
access to quality care, services and support so they can stay connected to their communities 
and remain independent for as long as possible. This includes those who experience younge r 
onset dementia. Labor will ensure better understanding and awareness of dementia by the 
general public so people living with dementia and their families feel less isolated and  alone.  
Supporting Australians with disability  
63. Labor  will ensure mainstream com munity services and facilities will be inclusive and accessible 
to people with disability and their families . Accessibility improvements to the transport system, 
such as fully accessible toilet and change facilities along key road and rail routes will furt her 
enhance the mobility and social participation of people with disabilities.  
64. Labor  believe s Australians with disability should be assured quality care and support, free of 
abuse and violence . Labor will stand up for victims of abuse in care.  
65. Labor  believ es that collaboration between people with disability, their families, advocacy 
groups, the workforce, unions and service providers is essential to the provision of high quality 
support services that enable people with disability to achieve their goals to participate fully in 
our society . 
66. Labor created the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) – the largest ever reform to 
Australia’s disability support system – because the old disability system was completely broken . 
For too long Australia’s disability  support systems failed to provide people with disability, their
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
56 
 
families and carers with the support they need . We see the NDIS as an important economic as 
well as social reform that will create jobs and unlock the productive potential of thousands of 
people with disability and their carers and provide many with a path to independence . 
67. In consultation with people with disability, their advocates, and the disability sector, Labor will 
ensure that assessment processes required to access the NDIS and calculat e allocated funds are 
fair, transparent, and genuinely accessible to people with disability.  
68. Labor will ensure the NDIS delivers on its promise to people with disability and will roll out the 
NDIS in full . As a core business of government, we will ensure the National Disability Insurance 
Agency (NDIA) is appropriately resourced and supported to deliver choice and controls for 
participants . We know that the effectiveness of the NDIS also requires ensuring strong links 
between the NDIS and the full ra nge of government and community services . We will therefore 
work with the states and territories to ensure the NDIS works effectively with other systems, 
like health, mental health, education and carer support.  
69. Labor will create new types of user -led servi ces to ensure people with disability have choice and 
control over the services they receive . 
70. Labor will work to ensure the NDIS delivers fair remuneration, job security and career 
development opportunities for  the disability sector workforce. Retaining and  attracting a 
qualiﬁed and experienced disability sector workforce ensures genuine choice and control for 
people with disability. Labor believes that decent pay and conditions and access to accredited 
training and continuing professional development are cr itical to growing and maintaining the 
NDIS workforce. Labor believes that NDIS pricing should support fair wages, conditions and job 
security. Labor will ensure that any worker delivering NDIS funded supports is deemed to be at 
a minimum covered by their r elevant Award. Labor will therefore work with disability services 
workers and their unions, service providers and people with disability to develop and 
implement a disability sector workforce strategy to improve sector capacity and maintain and 
enhance qua lity standards.  
71. Labor  will invest in research, evidence , and information to support service innovation, planning 
and quality, as well as informed choice by N DIS participants . We will ensure that speciﬁc services 
accessible through the NDIS will be decided according to the needs of NDIS participants, as fairly 
determined by people with disability, their advocates, and the disability sector.  
72. The only factor that should determine the level of care someone receives is the level of support 
they require, not the cause of their injury . Labor  will therefore ensure the National Injury 
Insurance Scheme (NIIS) complements the NDIS . A person -centred NIIS for catastrophic injuries 
will revolutionise support for people with disability by reducing the large inequities in l ifetime 
care and support that currently exists across Australia . This is critical for a sustainable NDIS.  
73. Those who care for sick and older relatives and people with disability and mental illness deserve 
acknowledgement and support for the job they do and their selfless contribution to Australia . 
Labor believes that c arers should have rights, choices, opportunities and capabilities to 
participate in economic, social and community life . 
74. Labor  recognise s that carers take on enormous responsibilities often at both a personal and a 
financial cost . Many carers experience substantial financial hardship, reduced education and 
employment prospects, lower levels of health and greater levels of anxiety and depres sion.
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
57 
 
75. Carers need effective employment conditions including transition to work when caring 
responsibilities change . Labor  will consult with carers, their representative peak bodies and 
service providers to identify and overcome impediments, including infle xible working 
arrangements , to providing  financial and practical support for carers in our community . 
76. The Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment should remain an essential part of our social 
safety net for people who need it . Labor  will ensure the se payments  are properly indexed so 
they keep pace with the cost and standard of living.  
A fair social security system  
77. Labor believes in a strong, adequate and fair social safety net and that there should not be 
poverty in a country like Australia.  Labor is c ommitted to a social security system that keeps 
people out of poverty, whether they are unemployed, working age or in retirement.  
78. Labor believes that s ocial security is an insurance for us all; a guarantee that as we face difficulty, 
disability or age, our  needs can be met.  
79. Labor has a history of structural reforms to protect the living standards of all Australians . Labor 
introduced the Age Pension in 1908 and unemployment benefits in 1945 . Labor understands 
the randomness of misfortune and will protect our social security system, to make sure it is 
there for those who need it.  
80. The Age Pension is critical to the dignity of senior Australians and Labor will protect it . We will 
ensure it is there for those who need it, and that it is indexed to keep  up with the cost and 
standard of living – along with the Disability Support Pension, Carer Payment and other 
pensions . Labor understands that most pensioners live on a fixed income for many years . Labor 
will work to decrease the cost of living, support ac cess to concessions , and deliver quality 
affordable healthcare.  
81. Labor believes that o ur social security system should work to keep children and families out of 
poverty, so they can learn and reach their potential.  Furthermore, the system should be 
reviewed  so that its equipped to meet future challenges that will aﬀect work such as 
technological change.  
82. Labor will make sure people who are looking for work get the ﬁnancial support they need to live 
a life of dignity through a strong social security system as well as the support they need to ﬁnd 
and keep a job. Payments, housing, health, education and employment opportunities should 
help keep people out of poverty and ensure all Australians have a decent standard of living.  
83. Labor in government will not pursue a ny expansion of the Cashless Debit card or community 
wide income management without clear evidence of community beneﬁt and informed 
community consent.  
84. Labor  will enable people’s participation in the economy and community by helping them gain 
the capacities  needed through employment, volunteering, community service and education . 
Our policies will aim to break the cycle of entrenched and multiple disadvantage in particular 
areas, reflecting the reality that poverty is often concentrated in certain suburbs an d towns – 
and that it can be overcome through policy choices and partnership with the community and 
business.
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIE TY  
     
 
58 
 
85. Labor recognises that loneliness is a crisis that is affecting too many Australians, and commits 
to developing and implementing a comprehensive na tional strategy to address loneliness and 
social isolation.  
Access to affordable housing  
86. Labor acknowledges that access to safe and secure housing is a basic human right and believes 
that housing aﬀordability is one of the biggest issues facing Australian s. Home ownership, for 
many, is out of reach. Many more Australians are also struggling to pay their rent and rates of 
homelessness are higher than ever before.  
87. Home ownership rates are at their lowest level in over 60 years, with ﬁrst home buyers 
struggl ing to save the required deposit to purchase a home. Labor will work with state, territory 
and local governments and industry and sector stakeholders to assist ﬁrst homebuyers to 
purchase their ﬁrst home and improve housing aﬀordability . 
88. There are more Aus tralians renting, and renting for longer, than ever before. This includes 
students, young people and older Australians living on their own. Labor recognises the 
signiﬁcance of Commonwealth Rent Assistance to help support people on low incomes renting 
in th e private rental market. Labor will work with the states, territory and local governments 
and industry stakeholders to help Australians who rent to have access to more secure, 
aﬀordable, quality, long term  housing.  
89. In Australia there are more people experi encing homelessness than ever before, particularly 
among women and children experiencing domestic violence, young people, LGBTIQ+ people, 
older women, veterans and Indigenous Australians. Labor will work with the state, territory and 
local governments, loc al organisations and the private sector to reduce homelessness and 
support people experiencing or at risk of  homelessness.  
90. Labor recognises that the responsibility of funding the construction and repair of social housing, 
including both public and communit y housing, is the shared responsibility of the 
Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments. Labor also recognises the profound 
economic and social beneﬁt of investing in social housing. Labor will work with state, territory 
and local governments to im prove access to public, community, and aﬀordable housing. 
Acknowledging that improved housing is needed to close the gap, Labor will also address the 
issue of inadequate housing and overcrowding among communities of First Nations  people.  
Support for the community sector  
91. Strong communities are fundamental to Labor’s egalitarian project . We believe in the value of 
mass membership organisations – from trade unions , to communities of faith and  local sporting 
clubs – in promoting community cohesion and buildin g bridges across diverse groups . Labor 
recognises the social benefits of volunteering, philanthropy and civic activism . 
92. Labor will protect the right of charities and non -profits to advocate on public policy issues, 
recognising that their voices enrich the democratic conversation . To ensure charities and non -
profits operate as effectively as possible, we will work with the sector to modernise regulations 
and remove duplicate reporting requirements . 
93. Labor recognises that a fair and equal society de pends on rich connections within and between 
community units. Just as loneliness stops individuals realising their potential and living fulﬁlling
CHAPTER 4: A STRONG AND HEALTHY SOCIETY   
     
 
59 
 
lives, communities with weak social bonds are less healthy and less productive than they could 
be. 
94. Community s ector organisations play a vital role in supporting the vulnerable . Labor believes in 
a respectful partnership between the government and the non -profit sector . Labor will work 
with the community sector to establish a model of funding which better addresse s the needs 
and interests of people they support and the local communities in which they work . This should 
include a focus on accessibility, sustainability, collaboration and the importance of early 
intervention . 
95. Labor recognises that community led organis ations have been an essential part of delivering 
services and building community capacity. Labor will prioritise funding for specialist services, 
including specialist services delivered by women’s , LGBTIQ, First Nations, disability and CALD  
groups.  
96. Labor r ecognises the role of communities of faith in supporting the community both formally in 
service delivery and informally through pastoral care. Ours is a pluralist democracy and we 
believe that the care in the community oﬀered, often through volunteers, for mally and 
informally, is an expression of people’s  faith. We commit to working with faith communities and 
others who give so much social and spiritual support to Australians.  
97. Labor recognises that non -proﬁt organisations are always better positioned than f or-proﬁt 
corporations to provide these crucial frontline support services. In the procurement of human 
services, Labor will remove the practice of competing on labour costs by ensuring tenders and 
grant programs are suﬃcient and appropriately funded to pro vide for adequate and safe 
staﬃng levels, and fair and reasonable wages and conditions.  
Humane a nimal welfare  
98. All animals should be treated humanely . Labor will work to achieve better animal welfare and 
consistent application and enforcement of animal protection statutes  by harmonising relevant 
federal, state and territory laws and codes . 
Fair and equal government services  
99. Labor  believe s that human service delivery should be defined by fair and equal government 
services for all citizens . The des ign of government services should place people at the centre . 
We will embrace new technologies to provide convenient, more efficient and more effective 
delivery of services  and support these with access to face to face services and in person support 
where people need and want this. Technology in service delivery will always be used with 
appropriate levels of checking and meaningful human oversight . We will never use technology 
to override the rights of individuals .

participate in the social, cultural and economic life of our nation free of hatred or harassment.  
 
2. Labor was instrumental in the creation and adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights in 1948, which recognises that human rights are to be enjoyed by all people, no matter 
who they are or where they live. These include civil and political rights, like the right to life, 
liberty, free speech and pri vacy as well as economic, social, religious and cultural rights, 
including the right to social security, health and education . 
 
3. Labor’s commitment to defending and advancing the principles enshrined in the Universal 
Declaration – both at home and abroad – is undiminished . That commitment is central to what 
Labor stands for and what Labor has always stood for.  
 
4. By protecting and promoting human rights, Labor will ensure that all Australians are able to 
participate fully in our democracy, our economy and our society . This will make us a stronger 
nation, a richer nation and a fairer nation.

consider whether it could be enhanced through a statutory charter of human ri ghts or other 
similar instrument .

We recognise that First  Nations people experience particular unacceptable disadvantage  as a 
consequence of injustice both historical and continuing, compared to other Australians . Labor 
will work in partnership with First Nations people to achieve the change they aspire to, incl uding 
Closing the Gap on  First Nations people’s  disadvantage . This commitment is underpinned by 
Labor’s support for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which includes the 
right to self -determination .
CHAPTER 5: AN EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE NATION   
     
 
61 
 
10. Labor believes Treaty is needed to reconcile the truth of Australia’s past with our future . A Labor 
Government will start the process of Treaty or treaties, recognising the importance of all parties 
being treaty -ready and treaty processes being pursued by states and territories . 
 
11. Labor acknowledges the historic injustices of the past committed against First Nations people 
and the need for the truthful telling of Australia’s history and a Makarrata Commission as part 
of the journey towards reconciliation . This includes the teaching of the history and culture of 
First Nations people and their contribution to the Australian story, as well as acknowledging 
events of national significance.  Labor will advocate for returning to their traditional owners, 
remains, artefacts and other items of cult ural signiﬁcance to First Nations people, which are 
currently held by foreign countries.  
 
12. Labor recognises that acknowledgement of First Nations people as traditional owners and 
continuing custodians of country is an important mark of respect and reconcili ation at 
appropriate events, including at the opening of the Federal Parliament.  Labor believes that 
reconciliation is an important vehicle for healing and justice in Australian society and Labor will 
continue to work with First Nations people to implement  Labor’s Reconciliation Action Plan, and 
to further treaty processes . 
 
13. A Labor Government’s policies will not be discriminatory and will ensure policies and service 
delivery focus strongly on meeting the needs and supporting the aspirations of First Nation s 
people . 
 
14. In recognition of the centrality of land and water to First Nations  people’s  spirituality, law, 
culture, economy and wellbeing, Labor supports  land rights and Native Title as property rights 
under Australian law and will work to accelerate the r esolution of outstanding land and Native

19. Labor is  committed to closing the Gap and to the investments and programs that are required 
to deliver that change . Labor regards closing the gap in life expectancy, employment, justice, 
health and education outcomes between First Nations people and other Australians as a 
national priority . We believe se lf-determination is fundamental to being able to achieve this . In 
recognition of higher rates of social disadvantage and additional needs, Labor will work in 
partnership with First Nations people to:  
a. improve culturally safe supports for families with a foc us on the early years ; 
b. reduce violence against women and children , and in communities generally;  
c. improve child safety by supporting programs that will help reduce the unacceptable 
number of First Nations  children in the child protection system, ensuring ch ildren in care 
maintain contact with their culture, language and community  including providing cultural 
support for all carers;  
d. support policies like justice reinvestment to reduce high rates of incarceration for First 
Nations people and provide federal le adership to prevent and ensure accountability for 
deaths in custody ;

comprehensive approach that goes beyond health services to include cultural wellbeing 
and connection to the la nd, education, environmental health and employment and

Generations . Labor  will work in partnership with the Stolen Generations and family members 
who continue to be affected by that legacy to comprehensively respond to their needs as a 
distinct group . We support the Healing Foundation and its work to aid healing in the 
communities  of First Nations people.  
 
21. Labor was the first Australian political party to develop a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Labor 
will continue to implement its RAP as endorsed at the 2018 National Conference and work 
towards developing future RAPs.  
Gender equality and women’s rights  
22. Labor has a proud legacy of advancing women’s rights and a long -held commitment to gender 
equality. We know that much remains to be done to eliminate discrimination, harassment and 
abuse including bonded labour and traﬃcking, and to achieve equality.
CHAPTER 5: AN EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE NATION   
     
 
63 
 
23. Labor  recognise s that achieving gender equality will require enduring commitment from 
government, working in partnership with business and the community to close the gend er pay 
gap, reduce violence against women, reach equal representation in public, private and 
community sector leadership , and improve health and wellbeing . We believe that achieving 
gender equality will make a major contribution to our nation’s social well being and economic 
prosperity . 
 
24. Enabling workforce participation is key to gender equality through creating good flexible jobs 
for women, better valuing feminised occupations, facilitating more women entering traditional 
male occupations and improving chil dcare access and affordability.  
 
25. Labor will promote and support women’s leadership in Australia’s parliaments, governments, 
senior levels in the public and private sectors and in communities throughout Australia to 
ensure the equal participation of men and  women in decision -making processes .

women;  
c. guide how we consider the impacts that policy and budget decisions have on Australian 
women; and  
d. reﬂect the diﬀerent experiences and needs of First Nations women, women from 
culturally diverse backgrounds, women with disabilities, rural women, older women, 
young women and girls, and LGBTIQ people.  
 
27. Labor  believe s that add ressing violence against women and their children must be a national 
priority that requires a partnership between all Australians . 
 
28. The prevalence of family violence in Australia is a national shame. Labor believes government 
has a responsibility to properly resource evidence -based programs that prevent family and 
gendered violence, support women and children to be safe, and change beh aviour. Systems of 
justice, social security, housing and industrial relations must work better to support women 
experiencing family violence. The next Labor government will invest in preventing and 
responding to family violence in partnership with LGBTIQ p eople, First Nations people, people 
from CALD communities, people with disability, and people living in remote, regional and rural 
areas, as well as faith and community groups.  
 
29. Labor  believe s that forced marriage is a  human rights abuse which disproportio nately affects 
young women and children . We will act to prevent this practice from occurring . 
Equality  for LGBTIQ + Australians  
30. Labor believes lesbian, gay, bi -sexual, transgender; intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) Australians 
deserve the same human rights, equal ity, respect and safety as every other Australian .
CHAPTER 5: AN EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE NATION

including to those with particular needs, those who are young, those who are First Nations 
people, those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and those living in 
rural,  regional and remote Australia;  
e. support intersex -led organisations to provide support to intersex persons and their 
families, and advocate on intersex issues; and

as they affect transgender and intersex people,  to ensure that male, female and non -
binary identity can be affirmed without discrimination . 
32. Labor will ensure schools are welcoming and supportive environments for all. We will support 
initiatives , as selected b y schools,  that promote understanding, inclusion and respect for every 
student.  
 
33. Labor opposes "reparative" or "gay conversion" therapies. Labor will work with advocates, 
survivors and professional bodies to ensure that these discredited and damaging pract ices are 
prohibited and to promote justice for those harmed by such practices.  
 
34. Labor will promote resolutions to support human rights protections for LGBTIQ people at the 
Human Rights Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations  as well as othe r 
international bodies . 
Equity for Disabled People  
35. People with disability have the same rights as all Australians and Labor believes that 
governments should help remove barriers to the full exercise of those rights to enable people 
with disability to parti cipate fully in society and exercise full choice and control over their lives.  
 
36. Labor recognises the National Disability Strategy is the key avenue for Australia to implement 
its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
We will act on the National Disability Strategy's priority areas to improve the lives of people 
with disability, their families and carers.  
 
37. Labor recognises the right of people with disability to work in an accessible workplace,  on equal 
footing with their peers. Labor understands the beneﬁts of a diverse workforce including people 
with disability, and will work to improve job opportunities, job readiness, and support in 
employmen t. 
A multicultural nation  
38. Modern Australia has been built through our multiculturalism - its greatest achievement . Labor 
is the party for, and of, multiculturalism . Labor is determined to ensure that the benefits of our
CHAPTER 5: AN EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE NATION   
     
 
65 
 
diversity are fully realised, so that no individual is held back and that our society and economy 
fulfil their potential . This requires consistent political leadership in support of multiculturalism, 
greater engagement with the full diversity of culturally , religiously  and linguistically diverse 
Australians, and a commitmen t to secure inclusive institutions to ensure no -one is left behind.  
 
39. Labor is committed to standing up for multiculturalism and culturally and linguistically diverse 
Australians, through policies which:  
a. work with communities to ensure that the diversity of  Australians is both measured and 
reflected in social, economic and political participation.  In particular, to ensure that our 
institutions reflect the society they serve and shape, and to support and encourage the 
participation and candidacy of culturally  and linguistically diverse Australians across all 
levels of government;   
b. ensure our democratic institutions are truly representative by reﬂecting Australia ’s 
cultural diversity;  
c. remove barriers to recent migrants’ participation in our economy and society,  and ensure 
government services redirect the needs of all Australians;  
d. keep our migration policies non -discriminatory;  
e. respect the heritage and traditional customs of migrants and their children;  
f. continue the family reunion program;  
g. encourage broad engagement with and respect for the principles underlying Australia’s 
citizenship – Australia’s democratic beliefs and laws, and the rights and responsibilities of  
Australian citizenship, to foster active citizenship for all Australians, in p articular recent 
migrants;  
h. ensure migrants, including refugees, are not economically exploited and have full access 
to the relevant workplace rights and protections; and  
i. recognise the ongoing benefits of cultural diversity to all Australians, and the role of 
government, working with community, in building an inclusive society.  
40. Labor is very concerned by the rise of racism and of the forces of division and will continue to  
oppose those who foster extremism, hatred, ethnic division or incitement to violence . Labor 
will combat racism with a zero -tolerance approach.  
 
41. Australian citizenship is a crucial part of recognising and encouraging participation in the 
Australian community . Labor will continue to encourage all permanent residents to become 
Australian citiz ens. Labor will remove unnecessary and unintended barriers to citizenship, 
providing a clear and efficient pathway to citizenship, particularly for vulnerable groups of 
migrants  and permanent protection visa holders , and prioritise the processing of applications 
by families, partners and children to ensure families are kept together.  
A better future for young people  
42. Labor will support young Australians to reach their full potential . By investing in their education, 
training, health and employment, Labor will equip young Australians to successfully negotiate 
the many challenges, opportunities and transitions that life in our nation offers . 
 
43. Labor will develop a national approach to children and the law, which will:
CHAPTER 5: AN EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE NATION   
     
 
66 
 
a. recognise the best interests and wellb eing of the child as a primary consideration ; 
b. set standards for court procedures where children are involved as witnesses, victims or 
offenders ; 
c. set standards for support, counselling and rehabilitation services for child victims and 
offenders within the c riminal justice system ; 
d. support research into the causes of juvenile crime ;  
e. continue to support the work of the National Children’s Commissioner ; and  
f. work to harmonise and improve the child protection laws and systems of the federal, state 
and territory jurisdictions.  
44. Labor recognises that young people are concerned about the future of our country and the 
world . Labor believes that Australia needs bette r representation of the voices of young people 
in our national debates and policy development . Labor will promote the involvement of young 
Australians  in decision -making processes and encourage the candidacy of young people across 
all levels of government . 
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion  
45. Labor will protect and promote the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in 
accordance with Australia’s  international obligations, including our obligations under Article 18 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
 
46. Labor recognises that the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief, to change a religion or 
belief, or not to have or  adopt a religion or belief, is absolute. Moreover, Labor believes in and 
supports the right of all Australians to have and to manifest their religion or beliefs, and the 
right of religious organisations to act in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, bel iefs or 
teachings of their faith. Such rights should be protected by law and, in accordance with Article 
18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, subject only to such limitations as 
are necessary to protect public safety, order, heal th, or morals or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others.  
 
47. Labor believes that people of faith deserve the same human rights, equality, respect and safety 
as every other Australian. No Australian should ever be viliﬁed , discriminated against  or 
subje cted to violence or threats of violence because of that person’s religion or religious belief. 
Labor will therefore ensure that Australia’s anti -viliﬁcation laws are ﬁt for purpose.  
Labor’s opposition to discrimination  
48. All Australians should be able to go  about their lives free from discrimination . Labor is the 
primary architect of the anti -discrimination law framework in Australia . We will continue to 
defend and enhance that framework to ensure that it is fit for purpose, accessible and promotes 
equality.
CHAPTER 5: AN EQUAL AND INCLUSIVE NATION   
     
 
67 
 
49. Labor will simplify and harmonise federal anti -discrimination laws by consolidating them into a 
single piece of legislation.  This will include a review of existing exemptions to ensure that they 
do not place Australians in a position where they cannot access essential social services.  
 
50. Labor believes it should continue to be unlawful to discriminate against any person on the basis 
of age, disability, race,  religion,  sex, gender identity, sex characteristics and sexual orientation .  
 
51. Labor recogni ses that discrimination is often multi -layered, with people experiencing 
discrimination on the basis of a number of intersecting attributes, and will work to ensure that 
federal anti -discrimination laws and programs properly address this.  
 
52. Labor believes t hat, regardless of age, all Australians should have the opportunity to contribute 
to our community and our economy . We will support the work of the Age Discrimination 
Commissioner to address the growing problem of age discrimination by removing barriers to  
older Australians participating in the workforce and providing better and more flexible work 
environments . 
53. Labor will continue to support a strong, independent Disability Discrimination Commissioner to 
advocate for people with disability affected by discr imination, and to proactively engage the 
community in understanding and contributing to improving the human rights of people with 
disability.

CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY  
Strong democratic and public institutions  
1. Labor believes that the health of Australia’s democratic and public institutions underpins the 
strength of our nation, because these institutions enable us to take effective and united action 
in the pursuit of our shared values and national aspirations.  
2. Labor is therefore committed to protecting and strengthening these institutions, which 
empower our nation to:  
a. effectively debate and resolve issues of national importance;  
b. make and uphold laws to improve the lives of Australians;  
c. address exclusion and disadv antage, particularly among First Nations people;  
d. hold free and fair elections;  
e. resolve disputes in our community peacefully; and  
f. deliver essential services to all Australians.  
3. Labor will work towards increasing the engagement of young people in Australian democracy, 
through  strengthening civics education in schools by:  
a. making the teaching of history and active citizenship compulsory in years 9 and 10, and 
ensuring that it is conducted by appropriately trained teachers;  
b. investigating the appropriate amount o f time to be dedicated to civics and citizenship 
education to at least 30 hours per year;  
c. reviewing the way in which civics and citizenship module of education are taught in 
Australian National Curriculum, with the aim of redesigning it to make it more eng aging 
for students; and  
d. ensuring the module includes content about First Nations history, and issues of civics and 
citizenship for Indigenous Australians.  
4. Labor will work towards increasing the engagement of citizens with the Australian Federal 
Parliament,  especially through strengthening the parliamentary committee system. Committee 
inquiries shine a light on the performance of government, draw on ideas and creativity from 
across our society, and bring the public into the work of the Parliament.  
5. Labor will  establish a Parliamentary Oﬃce of Science, modelled on the United Kingdom ’s 
Parliamentary  Oﬃce of Science and Technology, to provide independent, impartial scientiﬁc 
advice, evidence and data to the  Parliament,  and all Members  and Senators.

must end . A Labor government will listen to the Australian people, respect the truth and show 
strong moral and ethical leadership . 
 
7. Labor will make government open and accountable, and will have no tolerance for corruption . 
Labor will:
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY   
     
 
69

of a broad national anti -corruption plan ; 
b. improve whistle -blower protections for the public sector a nd extend them to the private 
sector ;

standards relating to their behaviour ; and  
f. at all times, uphold and defend the rule of law . 
8. Labor will always protect Australia’s democratic processes and institutions from foreign 
interference . 
Modernising the Australian Constitution  
9. Labor believes that the Constitution is a living document which should be amended to reflect 
contemporary Australia and to embody enduring Australian values . Labor will put important 
and long -sought -after constitutional reforms on the national agenda . 
10. Labor supports the Recognition of First Nations  peoples in the Australian Constitution, including 
an enshrined  voice to the Parliament, as outlined in the Uluru Statement from the Heart . In 
partnership with First Nations people , Labor will develop a concrete proposal for constitutional 
recognition which has the broad support of the First Nations people and fosters public su pport 
for change.  
11. Labor supports and will work toward establishing an Australian republic with an Australian head 
of state . 
12. Labor supports recognising local government in the Australian Constitution.  
13. Labor believes that other constitutional reforms, such as fixed, four -year terms for the House 
of Representatives and the Senate and the recognition of local government in the Australian 
Constitution , should be progressed through a new and independent Aust ralian Constitutional 
Commission . 
14. An Australian Constitutional Commission would  work with the Australian people and 
government to ensure that our Constitution remains relevant to the lives, values and aspirations 
of our nation and our people.  
A modern Fede ration  
15. Labor will work with state, territory and local governments to modernise our federation to 
improve the delivery of vital services, including health, education, transport, water and 
emergency services.
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY   
     
 
70 
 
16. Many issues facing Australia can only be address ed through cooperation at a national, state and 
local level . For that reason, Labor believes that a modern Australian federation is one in which 
all three  tiers  of government work together to serve the interests of the Australian community . 
17. Labor sees loca l government as a vital tier of Australian democracy . We will work in partnership 
with local government to create services and build infrastructure that will deliver benefits and 
opportunities to local communities . Local government needs a secure economic base. Labor 
will: 
a. provide long -term funding certainty;  
b. provide funding through the ongoing Financial Assistance Grants and index these 
appropriately;  
c. support funding for local government maintained roads and participate in a range of 
programs to provide di rect funding to local government;  
d. establish a mechanism to consult directly with local government to ensure it has strong 
and direct relationship with federal government;  
e. ensure local government has a voice within Infrastructure Australia and in Regional 
Development;  
f. work with local government to improve their eﬃciency and ﬁnancial sustainability ; and 
g. work with local, state and territory governments through National Cabinet to improve the 
ﬁnancial sustainability of local government.  
A public sector working for Australians  
18. Labor believes a strong Australian Public Service (APS) is necessary to protect the national 
interest and create a better society. Labor recognises the essential role of the APS in designing 
and delivering services for the public good and i n developing policy solutions to the challenges 
the nation faces both now and into the future. We will ensure the APS is properly resourced to 
deliver services to the Australian people in an eﬃcient and responsive way.  
19. After years of cuts and outsourcing from the Liberal National government, Labor will rebuild the 
capability and capacity of the public service to deliver better outcomes for the community.  
20. As a model employer the APS will provide secure and fairly remunerated jobs, trade union 
engagement, fl exible working conditions and opportunities for advancement for its employees, 
including through continuous education . 
21. A strong APS relies on the diversity of its employees . We will provide employment and 
promotion opportunities in the APS for people with diverse backgrounds, including in relation 
to First Australians and people with a disability . 
22. The APS will be subject to rigorous and democratic oversight by the Parliament, the Auditor -
General, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Public Service Com mission and other 
relevant bodies including independent and apolitical administrative review of its actions.
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY

An electoral system we can all trust  
23. Labor will strengthen and enhance the integrity of Australia’s electoral system  through overdue 
campaign financing reform and by removing barriers to participation in democratic processes 
for all Australians.  
24. We will minimise the disproportionate influence of vested interests in the democratic process 
by support ing an effective and p ractical public funding system of elections and limit ing the level 
of federal campaign expenditure, through the introduction of spending caps . 
25. Labor will introduce truth in political advertising laws which will further enhance the 
transparency of our elect oral processes and improve the integrity of the electoral system.  
26. Labor respects the independence of the Australian Electoral Commission and will give it the 
powers and resources it needs to ensure the integrity of the electoral system —including the 
creati on of a single national electoral roll capable of serving the needs of states and territories . 
27. Labor will protect the Australian electoral process from foreign and domestic interference and 
ensure that all claims of electoral malpractice are investigated . 
28. A strong democracy depends on all citizens being able to participate equally . It is not enough 
that Australia has compulsory voting, we must also endeavour to ensure voting is accessible to 
all through easy access to enrolment and to voting in person, pre -poll and by post.  
29. Labor believes in the democratic value of one vote one value and will continue to advance steps 
to ensure all citizens are fairly represented regardless of where they live.  
30. Labor will review the current rule about the voting rights of Aus tralians living abroad, 
recogni sing that they may retain strong links with Australia, including with family whose rights 
to income, education, environment protection and so on will continue to be of importance to 
parents wherever they are. Further, Austral ians overseas are still aﬀected by policy at home to 
do with pensions, superannuation, tax, and other issues.  
Healthy public debate  
31. In an era when media diversity, media freedom and quality public interest journalism and local 
news are under threat around the world, Labor will ensure Australians have access to a strong, 
healthy, diverse and independent media operating in the public interest . We will:  
a. properly fund and support the independence of Australia’s national broadcasters, the ABC 
and SBS  by – 
i. mainta ining the ABC and SBS as separate individual broadcasters;  
ii. maintain ing the ban on ABC advertising and sponsorship ; 
iii. oppos ing the privatisation of the ABC and SBS ; 
iv. ensur ing board members of the ABC and SBS are chosen through a rigorous and 
independent proces s; and 
v. maintain ing a staff -elected member on the ABC Board ; 
b. support and fund community broadcasting ;
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY   
     
 
72 
 
c. apply appropriate mechanisms to support Australian content ; 
d. ensure advertising is properly regulated and reflects community standards ; 
e. ensure Australians w ill continue to enjoy free coverage of events of national and cultural 
significance, including sporting events ; and  
f. ensure the Australian Communications and Media Authority has sufficient resources and 
regulatory powers to do its job.  
32. Labor will ensure Aus tralian charities and not -for-profit organisations are able to participate in 
public debate, in accordance with charities law, and remove politically motivated ‘gag clauses’ 
or restrictions that inhibit their ability to collaborate with Australian or inter national partners.  
33. Labor believes all Australians have the right to exercise their freedom of speech in a manner 
that respects the individual and collective rights enjoyed by other Australians and allows others 
to live in dignity, and free from violence or  the threat of violence . To this end, Labor will oppose 
any attempt to weaken the longstanding protections against hate speech in the Racial 
Discrimination Act.  
34. Labor will provide a strong regulatory framework to protect people’s right to privacy and ensure 
the security of their personal information, whether held in the public sector , not -for-profit 
sector  or the private sector, on paper or in digital form.  
Justice for all  
35. Access to justice is essential to the rule of law and integral to the enjoyment of basic human 
rights to which all Australians, and all people in Australia’s care, are entitled . Labor  will ensure 
our justice system is fair, simple, affordable and accessible . To this end, Labor will work with 
states and territories to ensure legal assistance services, including legal aid commissions, 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, Family Violence Prevention Legal Services, 
and Community Legal Centres are properly resourced.  
36. Labor embraces the rule of law and endorses the  basic principles of justice . These principles 
include that:  
a. people accused of a criminal offence are not compelled to incriminate themselves ; 
b. people are not subject to prolonged detention without charge ; 
c. persons charged with a criminal offence are presume d innocent until proved guilty before 
an independent court ; 
d. charged persons are tried without undue delay ; 
e. accused persons are given a fair trial ; 
f. people charged with serious criminal offences are provided with legal representation if 
they are unable to af ford legal representation of their own ; 
g. people shall not be found guilty of any crime, the elements of which did not constitute a 
crime at the time of its commission ; 
h. people convicted of a criminal offence shall have the right to appeal against conviction ;  
i. evidence obtained illegally, by torture, coercive techniques or by improper investigative 
practice is inadmissible ; and
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY   
     
 
73 
 
j. civil and criminal trials should take place before independent courts open to the 
public, with suppression and  non-publication  orders  only  to be made  in 
exceptional circumstances . 
37. Labor believes that these principles apply to all Australians equally, and we will work to ensure 
that this is the case for those who have been marginalised by the justice system, including First 
Australians, w omen and young oﬀenders.  Labor will be a leader in tackling recidivism and to 
help deliver nationally consistent approaches to fair and equitable justice for our most 
vulnerable Australians.  Our system of justice should : 
a. provide security for all Australians ; 
b. protect property ; 
c. deter, punish and prevent crime ; 
d. compensate victims ; and 
e. rehabilitate offenders.  
38. Labor is committed to protecting and upholding the right of the legal assistance sector to 
advocate policy and law reform to remedy systemic issues  and to improve the justice system.  
39. Labor believes that access to justice is strengthened by ensuring that class actions are available 
to members of a group who have an essentially common cause of action.  
40. A Labor Government will work closely  with State and Territory governments to review the age 
of criminal  responsibility, paying regard to current international standards, and what is best for 
children, for families, and for the communities in which they live.  
41. Labor  will support effective earl y intervention programs which assist disadvantaged 
communities . 
42. Labor  will ensure the Commonwealth’s investigation, prosecution, defence and judicial 
processes are separate, independent, properly resourced and accountable.  
43. Labor will always respect the ind ependence of the judiciary, which is fundamental to the rule 
of law and our democratic society . 
44. Labor will ensure judicial and tribunal appointments are made through a transparent and merit -
based process in which all those eligible for appointment to judic ial office have the opportunity 
to be fairly and properly considered . 
45. Sentencing should achieve deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation . Labor support s the just 
and humane treatment of accused people in custody and offenders in prison . To this end, we 
will comply with Australia’s international human rights obligations in relation to the treatment 
of prisoners.  
46. Labor will provide federal leadership to end high rates of incarceration and deaths in custody of 
First Nations people, including facilitating col laboration between relevant federal and state 
agencies, supporting policies of justice reinvestment, and ensuring sustainable funding of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services.
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY   
     
 
74 
 
47. Labor supports the appropriate use of noncustodial sentencing opt ions for all offenders . This 
principle is particularly important for young people, people with mental illness, people with 
cognitive impairment, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, women, and people 
convicted of minor oﬀences  and every effort sho uld be made to divert children from long -term 
involvement in the criminal justice system . Labor will take all reasonable steps to ensure minors 
are not incarcerated in adult prisons.  A Labor Government will work closely with State and 
Territory governments  to review the age of criminal responsibility, paying regard to current 
international standards, and what is best for children, for families, and for the communities in 
which they live.  
48. Labor opposes mandatory sentencing . In substituting the decisions of p oliticians for those of 
judges, mandatory sentencing undermines the independence of the judiciary . It leads to unjust 
outcomes and is often discriminatory in practice . Mandatory sentencing does not reduce crime, 
and leads to perverse consequences that unde rmine community safety, such as by making it 
more difficult to successfully prosecute criminals.  
49. Law reform is an ongoing process in a healthy society, and we will continue to reform laws and  
our legal system to reflect the traditions, values and aspiratio ns of all Australians, and meet the 
needs of our modern democratic society . 
50. Labor will:  
a. recognise that health care is a human right, everyone is entitled to fair and equal health 
care, including those in the criminal justice system so ensure that every individual in the 
corrections system is granted access to Medicare;  
b. improve the screening and treatment capacity of forensic services through better linkages 
and support from Medicare; and  
c. require the NDIA to work with state and territory corrections  systems to develop a basic 
functional assessment for every prisoner on admission to ensure that those with a 
disability are able to access the NDIS in order to get the additional supports they need 
whilst in prison and to transition successfully back into  the community once their sentence 
is complete . 
Family law  that is fair  
51. Labor will restore Australia’s long -neglected family law system so that it is once again properly 
resourced, simpler to use and delivers justice and fairness for Australian families . When Labor 
enacted the Family Law Act in 1975, we established a family law system that was admired 
around the world . Under a Labor government, we will again have a system which is effective, 
accessible and fair.  Australian families need a specialised and su perior federal court to deal with 
family law matters, and in government Labor will ensure that need is met.  
52. Labor will ensure that the best interests of children will always be the paramount consideration 
in resolving family law disputes . 
53. Labor will ensure  that family courts and family law services protect those at risk of family 
violence, and that they are able to address the particular needs, customs and practices of 
Australia’s diverse cultures .
CHAPTER 6: STRENGTHENING AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY   
     
 
75 
 
54. Labor will ensure that community -based services such as cou nselling and family dispute 
resolution services are accessible, affordable and equipped to resolve entrenched disputes 
fairly and efficiently so that litigation is always a last resort.  
55. Labor will promote and defend the continued existence of the Family Co urt of Australia, 
operating as a specialised and superior federal court for Australian families.
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
76 
 
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD  
Renewing Australia’s foreign policy traditions  
1. We live in a time of considerable  global strategic change, includin g in our region . Labor has 
successfully led Australia in such times in the past.  Labor’s approach will be grounded in our 
belief in our country and our determination to safeguard its people, its values and its 
sovereignty . Labor will protect and promote Au stralia’s national interests and values in a time 
of change . We will build on the foreign policy and defence traditions that have underpinned 
Australia’s relations with our region and the world . Under Labor, Australia will be an enduring 
ally, a constructi ve regional partner and a responsible international citizen . Our approach to 
international affairs will be guided by our interests: national security, economic prosperity, 
regional stability and co -operation, and adherence to the rules based international order . It will 
be informed by our values: our belief in democracy, liberty, the rule of law and human rights . It 
will reflect our identity: an independent, inclusive and diverse nation confident of our place in 
the world, drawing strength and pride from th e waves of immigrants and from our First Nations 
people.  
2. Labor’s foreign policy and national security policy recognises the rapidly changing realities of 
the global order, including in the Indo -Pacific region . Newly competitive power relationships are 
challenging traditional security settings and the rules -based global order . Unresolved territorial 
disputes and pre -emptive claims to oceanic features are giving rise to potential flashpoints in 
our region . Growing military capability in Asia is increasing the potential for regional conflicts . 
The rise of extremists in the Middle East and Africa, and the export to our region of their 
perverse ideology, is threatening Australia's and the region’s security and potential prosperity . 
3. Labor wil l give particular attention to renewing those areas of foreign policy that contribute 
most eﬀectively to strengthening national security. This approach recognises that today ’s global 
problems require political solutions and the cost eﬀectiveness of peacefu l conﬂict resolution, 
wherever it is possible. Labor will reverse the Coalition ’s policies of eroding Australia ’s 
diplomatic capacity, which have left Australia with weaker overseas representation than any 
other G20 country. Labor will steadily improve the  ﬁnancing, staﬃng and expertise of Australia ’s 
diplomats,  enabling stronger approaches to conﬂict prevention, peacebuilding and multilateral 
participation.  
Defenders of Australia’s sovereignty  
4. Labor will ensure our defence forces, security agencies, police  and emergency services are 
always appropriately resourced and given the necessary powers to respond to  defend 
Australia’s sovereignty.  Labor will work closely with our neighbours, international allies and 
international institutions to meet the security ch allenges posed by terrorism  including right -
wing extremism and the rising risks of cyber -attack, economic coercion, and foreign political 
and social interference . 
5. Labor will always work responsibly and constructively to improve our national security laws a nd 
to ensure our security agencies and police can employ the powers they already have, and can 
acquire such additional powers they may need to meet the changing national security threats 
we face as a nation . Labor will ensure those powers are consistent wi th the long -standing values 
and hard -won liberties that help to define Australia as a democratic nation that always upholds 
the freedom and privacy of its citizens . Labor will enhance existing mechanisms to ensure  
parliamentary and statutory oversight of i ntelligence agencies is commensurate with their
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
77 
 
increasing responsibilities and powers.  Powers exercised by security agencies which impinge on 
the fundamental rights of citizens should wherever possible be authorised by warrant and 
reviewable by a court.  
6. Labor’s protection of the Australian people will begin with an uncompromising attitude towards 
border security . Labor will fund and maintain robust border security measures that support the 
orderly processing of migration to our country and protect our national interest and our 
national borders . 
7. Labor will ensure Australia’s capabilities to combat cyber security threats are up to date and 
that our laws are suitably flexible and able to respond to evolving threats.  
An enduring friend and ally  
8. Labor will s trengthen Australia's external relations and diplomatic efforts , taking advantage of 
the cultural and inter -personal relationships made possible by our large immigrant population.  
9. Under Labor, the United States will remain our closest security ally, formal ised through the 
ANZUS Treaty . Labor will strengthen Australia's close relationship with the US, reflecting our 
two nations’ common democratic values, respect for the rule of law and mutual commitment 
to international peace and security . We acknowledge the  US Alliance for its vital importance to 
Australia's national security requirements and the United States’ long -term role in underpinning 
broader st ability in our region.  
10. Recognising that Labor ’s foreign policy will be informed by our belief in democracy, liberty, the 
rule of law and human  rights, a future Labor government will work with likeminded democratic 
nations to uphold and defend democracy, including through a Global Summit of Democratic 
Nations.  
11. Labor values Australia’s friendship and partnership w ith India and Japan as fellow democracies. 
India’s growing leadership role in the Indo -Paciﬁc region and the world is valued and will be 
supported by a Labor government. Labor will continue to strengthen Australia’s engagement 
with India and Japan and buil d on opportunities to advance our shared interests.  
12. Labor believes that China is, and will continue to be, of great importance to Australia, to our 
region and to the world . It is in both our countries’ interests to have a productive  relationship, 
even when there are differences or disagreement . We must engage effectively with China while 
always standing up for our democratic values , including human rights, as well as advancin g our 
national interests and safeguarding our sovereignty . 
13.  Labor seeks to strengthen economic, security, social, cultural and educational ties with 
countries including Japan, Korea, India and Indonesia based on mutual respect and a sense of 
genuine partnership in our own Indo -Paciﬁc region. Labor supports enhanced  cooperation 
through rules -based institutions and opportunities for regional engagement including the 
Paciﬁc Islands Forum (PIF), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the East Asia 
Summit (EAS), the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) and  the Asia Paciﬁc Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) Forum. Labor will continue to work in our region, including with relevant 
ﬁnancial institutions, to meet the development and infrastructure needs of our region. In 
particular, a Labor government will commit reso urces and pursue closer relationships and 
cooperation  with ASEAN and its members. Deepening of relationships and mutual trust may 
mean that, one day, ASEAN membership could be a natural step, desired by our neighbours and
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
78 
 
seen as logical by Australians. La bor supports deep and sustained engagement with Paciﬁc 
Island countries and will maintain Australia ’s position as the region ’s preferred development 
and security partner . 
14. Labor acknowledges the vital importance to Australia of our relationship with Indones ia—as 
one of our nearest neighbours and the world's third largest democracy —and will seek to deepen 
social and cultural ties and increased trade between our two countries . 
15. Labor will ensure the languages of the region are taught more widely in our schools.  
16. Labor will strengthen Australia's links with Muslim -majority countries , including through the 
Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.  
17. Labor supports an enduring and just two -state solution to the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, based 
on the right of Israel to live in peace within secure borders internationally recognised and 
agreed by the parties, and reflecting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian  people to also 
live in peace and security within their own state.  
Self-reliant d efence and peacemaking  
18. Labor's defence policy is founded of the principle of Australian self -reliance . Australia's armed 
forces need to be able to defend Australia against credible threats without relying on the 
combat forces or capabilities of other countries . Labor will give our armed forces  the personnel, 
skills, equipment and other resources they need to do this vital job . 
19. Labor is committed to ensuring defence spending reflects our country’s strategic circumstances 
and accords with the international benchmark of two per cent o f GDP . 
20. Labor is committed to local jobs and local content in Australia’s defence procurement and 
sustainment projects, including with respect to major platforms like submarines and ships. This 
is an opportunity to develop sovereign industrial capability, a  more advanced manufacturing 
sector, and secure, decent, long -term jobs for Australians. Labor will implement a strategy to 
deliver concrete rules and plans to maximise local content, develop sovereign industrial and 
research capabilities, and build -up the  skills and expertise of the Australian workforce. Labor 
will negotiate appropriate, speciﬁc, enforceable and audited Australian Industry Content (AIC) 
commitments into the contractual arrangements for all major defence materiel procurements 
and local defe nce contracts. Labor will also ensure transparent public disclosure of AIC 
commitments.  
21. Labor will foster a strong national defence industry able to provide our sailors, soldiers and 
aviators with the best and safest equipment available while maintaining t he scientific, technical 
and manufacturing skills and capacities necessary for Australia’s long -term defence needs  and 
maximising the national economic security dividend from supporting local industry capability . 
This will require national eﬀort and commit ment on the part of political parties, government, 
the Australian Defence Force, vocational and tertiary institutions, local defence industry and 
relevant unions.  
22. Our self -reliant defence policy will be enhanced by strong bilateral and multilateral defence  
relationships . Where appropriate, Labor will strengthen existing defence ties with our key allies 
and through the United Nations ( UN), as well as building new and strengthening existing 
relationships within the lndo -Pacific region.
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
79 
 
23. Labor will engage in active defence cooperation efforts with our neighbours to preserve peace, 
prosperity, stability and security in the Indo -Pacific region . We regard these efforts as 
fundamental to Australia's own national security . A major objective of our engagement will b e 
to promote the professionalisation of neighbouring military forces, including their adherence 
to the rules of armed conflict and their respect for the rule of law and human rights.  
24. Labor supports the use of facilities in Australia by the armed forces of friendly countries for 
combined exercises, training and goodwill visits, provided that in times of peace:  
a. the use of Australian ports by foreign warships does not extend to the home porting of 
any of those vessels in Australia;  
b. the staging of military airc raft through Australian airfields or airspace shall only be for such 
purposes as may be agreed beforehand by the Australian Government;  
c. no nuclear, biological or chemical weapons may be stored or stationed in Australia; and  
d. nuclear powered vessels visit only those ports which have been determined as being 
suitable for those vessels and provided also that all other safety precautions and 
conditions deemed necessary by the relevant Australian authorities are complied with by 
the vessels concerned and appropriate environmental safeguards are in place.  
Partners for peace and prosperity in our region  
25. Labor believes Australia’s security and prosperity are strengthened when we are an active 
partner in the Indo -Pacific region . Labor’s priorities for the regi on include:  
a. the continuation of the liberal rules -based order in which military and economic power is 
not the only decisive factor;  
b. promoting the centrality of ASEAN as a key platform for regional stability and ASEAN 
nations as key bilateral relationships for Australia;  
c. focussing on our special relationship with Pacific Island countries in our near region;  
d. advancing the power of our international development and cooperation programs to 
support the stability, security and economic development of Pacific Isla nd countries;  
e. the continued constructive engagement of the United States in the Indo -Pacific; and  
f. regional co -operation and engagement.  
Supporting the international rules -based  order  
26. Labor strongly supports multilateralism . Australia is a founding member o f the United Nations, 
the World Trade Organisation, a member of the G20 and an active player in many international 
institutions . We know that Australia’s sovereignty is enhanced by multilateralism, where 
engagement between nations is governed by internatio nally agreed rules and norms. 
Multilateral trade agreements have been shown to deliver larger economic and social beneﬁts 
than regional or bilateral preferential agreements. A rules -based, multilateral system, 
underpinned by core and enforceable labour and  environmental standards, provides for 
fairness and equity.
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
80 
 
27. Labor recognises that Australia’s security and prosperity relies on our continued economic 
engagement with the world – and integration with our region – including through trade and 
investment.  
28. Labor acknowledges that open trade agreements and comprehensive economic partnerships 
have become matters of strategic and geopolitical significance . Labor will at all times act in the 
national interest and in accordance with Australia’s international obliga tions in dealing with 
open trade agreements and comprehensive economic partnerships.  
29. Any process  to obtain  a Labour  Agreement  must  be thorough,  genuine,  with  eﬀective  
consultation  with  trade  unions and have rigorous oversight applied to its operation. Labour 
Agreements must only be used to address acute and temporary  skill shortages  across  
regional  Australia.  Importantly,  overseas  workers  should  only  be a temporary  need, not  part  
of permanent  business  model.  The Coalition  Government  has provi ded unscrupulous  
employers  and labour hire ﬁrms with a green light by systematically approving labour 
agreements without appropriate labour market testing,  genuine  trade  union  consultation  
and safeguards  for ensuring  compliance  after  approval.  Labor  will increase the  Temporary  
Skilled  Migration  Income  Threshold  and enforce  an approval  process  that  requires  the 
Department  of Home  Aﬀairs  to consult  with  trade  unions  and apply  greater  scrutiny  and 
compliance  measures  against  employers. Labour  Agreements  must  be assessed  regularly,  
with  the skills  and training  of Australians  focussed  on ending  labour shortages and 
employing  Australians.  
30. Labor  believe s that many of the significant challenges facing the contemporary world —
terrorism, climate change , pandemics,  growing economic inequality and the global 
displacement of people —can only be effectively addressed through international co -operation . 
Continuing to deepen Australia’s bilateral and multilateral trading relationships, particularly in 
our region, and strengthening our relationships with allies and aligned nations will be essential 
to building the region and world we want.  
31. Labor holds the promotion of democracy, individual freedom and human rights as important 
foreign policy objectives to be  pursued through diplomatic, economic and international 
development assistance means . Labor will work to uphold human rights around the world, 
including freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of assembly and expression, 
the rights of Indigeno us peoples around the world  including their right to self -determination , 
the rights of persons living with disabilities and LGBTIQ rights.  We will be forthright about 
human rights violations overseas and will raise these with the governments concerned, 
including through bilateral representations and formal bilateral human rights dialogues as well 
as appropriate multilateral avenues . When necessary, we will support targeted sanctions 
agreed by the international community to protect human rights in ways that do not hurt the 
population of the country in question . We support global adherence to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other key human rights instruments and will ensure all human 
rights instruments ratified by Australia are observed in domest ic law.  Labor supports the 
introduction of Magnitsky -style legislation to target human rights abusers to send a strong 
signal to those committing human rights abuses abroad and to defend our democratic 
institutions.  
32. Labor holds state repression of trade unionism to be a violation of human rights . Labor  support s 
the work of the International Labour Organisation . Labor also supports  regional trade union 
cooperation, international treaties , and development programs that uphold labour rights
the work of the International Labour Organisation . Labor also supports  regional trade union 
cooperation, international treaties , and development programs that uphold labour rights 
including i n the Indo -Pacific region.
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
81 
 
33. Labor will support international efforts to eradicate the exploitation of child labour  and modern 
slavery . 
34. Labor will work within the international system to promote and protect the rights of people 
with disability, including thr ough its development assistance programs.  
35. Labor supports the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and supports efforts to 
increase indigenous participation in UN forums.  
36. Labor will champion gender equality and the economic, social and politic al empowerment of 
women and girls . We will pursue measures to reduce violence against women and girls, 
particularly with Australia's Pacific neighbours, and acknowledge the disproportionate suffering 
experienced by women in conflict zones . 
37. Labor will activ ely advocate for the abolition of the death penalty and torture across the world . 
38. Labor strongly supports the maintenance of a rules based international order, auspiced and 
supported by multilateralism and the United Nations . We support strengthening the U nited 
Nations' capacity in preventive diplomacy , peace building, peacemaking, peace keeping and 
peace enforcement . 
39. Labor supports the work of the International Criminal Court and its application of the principle 
of complementarity as a key part of Australi a's ongoing commitment to international criminal 
justice.  
Eradicating biological, chemical and nuclear weapons  
40. Labor will act with urgency and determination to rid the world of biological, chemical and 
nuclear weapons.  Labor will build on Australia’s stron g history of leading international action by 
working with our partners and allies to build consensus for action, negot iate new treaties and 
instruments, and promote adherence to and implementation of existing treaties and 
instruments.  
Emergency management : playing our part  
41. Labor will provide strong leadership to improve Australia’s emergency management capacity 
and readiness for disasters  at home and abroad.  Our approach will emphasise prevention, 
mitigation and preparation to improve response an d recovery.  
42. The incidence and severity of natural disasters in Australia around the world is increasing, and 
in an increasingly connected world these disasters are having broader and longer -lasting 
disruptive impacts on individuals and economies. According ly, our capacity to prepare for, 
respond to and build back better after disasters must keep pace. Under Labor, Australia's 
foreign policy eﬀorts and international development programs will emphasise eﬀorts to build 
resilient communities by preventing, miti gating and preparing for disasters both at home and 
in the Indo -Paciﬁc region, embedding prevention and preparations for climate change related 
challenges at every  level. Labor will deliver a safer and fairer disaster management framework 
by promoting and integrating the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.  
43. Labor recognises  that, in addition to natural disasters,  other types of emergencies require 
international cooperation, including global public health emergencies . An interconnected world
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
82 
 
increases the risk of pandemics; transparent engagement and coordinated preparation and 
response are crucial for managing the se risks . 
44. Local governments are more often than not the ﬁrst to respond to natural disasters. Labor sees 
local governments as a key partner in emergency management.  Labor believes local 
governments' important role must be recognised, supported and directly  funded including for 
clean -up and reconstruction eﬀorts, as well as being part of discussions with Federal and State 
governments in terms of natural disaster funding distribution and mitigation.  Local government 
workers who are at the forefront during bus hﬁres, severe storm events and other natural 
disasters should be provided all necessary support. Labor will ensure that councils are provided 
with prompt funding and reimbursements by the Federal governments, for natural disaster 
events and work with State  Governments to ensure the same arrangements for State 
emergency declaration, for work undertaken by employees . 
Active climate change and e nvironmental diplomacy  
45. Labor believes that working to ensure global action on climate change and the p rotecti on of  the 
global environment  should be a core objective of Australia’s foreign policy . Climate change 
represents an existential threat to humanity and is the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, 
security and wellbeing of the peoples  in the Pacific.  Environmental degradation contributes to 
social and political conflict and undermines regional and international security . Labor will lead 
in multilateral forums to achieve global action on climate change,  environmental protection and 
sustainable development . Ensuring traditional owners as well as the entire community are 
included in program design and implementation will be a priority . Labor will:  
a. support implementation of the Paris Accord, with the goal of limiting global warming to 
less than 2 degrees above pre -industrial levels and taking efforts to limit warming to 1.5 
degrees above pre -industrial levels  and be an active participant in the UNFCCC ; 
b. work to further strengthen the Antarctic Treaty System with particular emphasis on 
enhanci ng environmental protection;  
c. drive diplomatic engagement with like -minded nations on international instruments to 
better protect the world’s oceans; and  
d. work through international forums to address unsustainable fishing practices worldwide 
with the establi shment of protected areas a particular priority . We will energetically seek 
to combat unsustainable, illegal and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean , work to 
strengthen the law of the sea to improve sustainable ocean management  and support 
progress t owards a treaty that protects the high seas . 
46. Labor remains firmly opposed to all commercial and scientific whaling, and will vigorously 
pursue all options to implement Australia's objective of a worldwide ban on whaling and to 
ensure Japan adheres to the l andmark ruling in the International Court of Justice against Japan’s 
Antarctic ‘scientific’ whaling program.  
Using our aid to promote prosperity  
47. Labor believes our international development program should reflect Australia’s generous 
spirit, and advance ou r national interests, consistent with our values: our belief in democracy, 
liberty, the rule of law and human rights . Labor will rebuild Australia’s international 
development program and increase Official Development Assistance to internationally
CHAPTER 7: AUSTRALIA’S PLACE IN THE WORLD   
     
 
83 
 
accepted levels in a timely manner . We will work with the international community to achieve 
the longstanding funding targets contained in the Sustainab le Development Goals . Labor will, 
over time, achieve a funding target for the international development program o f at least 0.5 
per cent of Gross National Income . Labor will increase aid as a percentage of Gross National 
Income every year that we are in office starting with our first budget.  
48. Labor will ensure Australian international development addresses:  
a. poverty reduction;

g. global humanitarian crises and the root causes of crisis, conﬂict, instability and insecurity;  
h. empowerment of people with disabilities; and  
i. gender equality and empowerment of women and girls as a key objective, including 
ensuring at least 80 per cent of Australia ’s aid investments address gender issues and 
tackli ng violence against women and children.  
49. Labor will implement  the Sustainable Development Goal process as a global blueprint to end 
extreme poverty. The SDGs will guide Labor ’s plan for Australia ’s international development 
program.  
50. Labor's international de velopment program will be inclusive and non -discriminatory, and will 
promote human rights.  
51. Labor ’s international development program will be delivered through an appropriate balance

eﬀectiveness.  
Protecting Australians overseas  
52. Australia should protect the safety of Australians overseas . Labor will deliver a high standard of 
travel advice and consular assistance to all Australians overseas and provide timely and 
appropriate  assistance to those who require it .

56. Labor will continue to support a modern, dedicated occupational health and safety regime for 
all personnel, supported by a fair and supportive military rehabilitation and compensation

support to make a success of their post -service lives . Our post -service support will extend to the 
partners and family members of service personnel and provide adequate programs to assist 
them.  
58. Labor acknowledges the challenges faced by veterans and their families and is committed to 
improving their lives. This includes the transition into civilian life, ready access to ﬁnancial 
welfare and targeted support, the troubling rates of suicide and domestic and family violence 
as a result of post -service stress, and the role of Ex - Service Organisations within the welfare 
support space.  
59. Labor will respond to the welfa re needs of veterans and their families through services that 
respond to their lived experiences and focus on the diﬀerent facets of their lives. This includes

Trade  
1. Labor  supports trade between Australia and the rest of the world because trade generates 
economic growth, creates jobs, improves living standards and reduces poverty.  Labor has a long 
record as an advocate for an open global trading system.  Reducing barriers to  trade creates 
more competitive industries and benefits consumers through lower prices and greater choice.  
Trade is a pathway to a high -skill, high -wage future for working Australians.  
2. Australia’s trade success depends on its international competitiveness.  There will be important 
trading opportunities for Australia in coming years through engaging with the Asia -Pacific region 
and ensuring our businesses take part in global value chains.  Labor will ensure Australia can 
realise these opportunities through pol icies to improve Australia’s international 
competitiveness and to give businesses and individuals the skills and capabilities they need to 
succeed in a globalised economy.  
3. The benefits of trade can and must be shared fairly, both at home and abroad.  Labor will invest 
in education, training, skills and innovation, building Australia's national infrastructure, and 
promoting the health and welfare of the community so Australians benefit from the 
opportunities created by trade.  While the benefits of trade liber alisation are significant, they 
can come at a cost to sectors, workers and regions that are disadvantaged by structural change 
in our economy.  Particularly in the short -term, adjustment support is needed for some sectors, 
workers and regional communities t o ensure they are lifted up, not left behind, by economic 
change.  Labor will develop industry policy and provide structural assistance to sectors of the 
economy, workers and regions which are impacted by economic change.  
4. Labor  supports  Australian  industry,  including  agriculture,  manufacturing,  minerals  including  
coal,  oil and gas, and services  having  access  to global  markets  in accordance  with  Labor ’s policy  
framework  as described  here.  Economic growth has been good for developing countries, but in 
many economies these benefits have not been fairly shared.  More equal economic growth will 
create decent jobs, lifting people out of poverty, giving them economic independence and 
supporting human rights.  Labor is committed to trade policies consistent with Aus tralian values 
of justice and equality, community views, workers’ rights and the interests of developing 
countries.  
5. Labor supports the open, rules -based, multilateral trading system under the auspices of the 
World Trade Organisation.  Multilateral trade agr eements have been shown to deliver larger 
economic and social benefits than regional or bilateral preferential agreements.  A rules -based, 
multilateral system, underpinned by core and enforceable labour and environmental standards, 
provides a framework for fairness and equity and is the most effective means to ensure 
governments around the world do not resort to universally damaging protectionism.  
6. Labor will oppose low -quality, piecemeal trade agreements in favour of fair and transparent 
multilateral agreeme nts. When multilateral trade negotiations are not making satisfactory 
progress, Labor will consider high -quality regional or bilateral trade agreements that are in 
Australia’s national interest and that support the multilateral trading system.  Trade agreem ents 
must be consistent with Australia’s social and economic values, be based on widespread 
consultation, provide for appropriate minimum and enforceable labour and environmental
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
88 
 
 
standards, take account of social and economic impacts and allow sovereign go vernments to 
make decisions and implement policies in the interests of their citizens.  
7. Labor will prohibit through legislation the Commonwealth signing trade agreements that:  
a. Waive labour market testing;  
b. Include investor state dispute settlement provisions ; 
c. Include provisions that require the privatisation of any public services;  
d. Include provisions that undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme;  
e. Include provisions that undermine any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory 
relating to anti -dumping ; 
f. Include provisions that limit the right of the Commonwealth to regulate in the interests of 
public welfare or in relation to safe products ; 
g. Include provisions that have the effect of restricting the Commonwealth’s procurement 
arrangements from any form o f preference for the purpose of:  
i. Protecting Australia’s essential security interests;  
ii. Benefiting local small and medium enterprises;  
iii. Protecting national treasures  
iv. Implementing measures for the health, welfare and economic and social 
advancement of Indigen ous people;  
v. Promoting ethical standards and sustainable development th rough ethical 
procurement  
vi. Providing for the full, fair and reasonable participation of local enterprises in 
government contracts as outlined in Commonwealth, state and territory industr y 
participation policies and successor programs and policies; and  
vii. Maintaining the Australian industry capability programs and its successor 
programs and policies . 
8. Labor will legislate so that trade agreements signed by the Commonwealth:  
a. Require skills assessments (including practical and theoretical testing) to be undertaken 
in Australia and not restrict such skills assessments for temporary visa holders . 
b. Must include in any future bi -lateral trade agreement a labour chapter with enforceable 
internationally recognised labour standards . 
c. Should seek to include a labour chapter with enforceable internationally recognised 
labour standards in any regional or multilateral trade agreements . 
9. Labor believes that the process of developing, negotiating and ﬁ nalising trade agreements 
should be transparent, consultative and subject to the processes of the parliament. However, 
under the current framework, trade agreements are the prerogative of Executive Government,
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
89 
 
 
and the Parliament only determines enabling le gislation designed to give eﬀect to certain 
limited provisions of the agreement.  
10. Labor in Opposition will:  
a. Seek written conﬁrmation from the government that any trade agreement signed by the 
government does not violate clauses 7 and 8;  
b. Undertake formal con sultation with aﬀected unions about the impact of any proposed 
trade agreement;  
c. Labor will actively campaign against trade agreements that do not comply with clauses 7 
or 8 above, including by making shadow ministerial statements, participating in public 
campaigns, demanding that the Commonwealth conduct rigorous independent economic 
analysis and debating the merits of the agreement in the Parliament and Parliamentary 
Committees ; 
d. Amend parliamentary procedures to require an independent economic assessment o f the 
impact of each agreement to be included in the report of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Treaties to the parliament; and  
e. Vote against any enabling legislation for agreements, where the enabling legislation itself 
does not comply with clauses 7 or 8 a bove.  
11. If prior to the election of a Labor government, trade agreements are signed which are not 
consistent with the above, Labor in government will seek the renegotiation of the agreement 
to ensure it is consistent with the above points before bringing any  enabling legislation before 
the Parliament.  
12. Labor supports trade and investment liberalisation through the Asia –Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum.  APEC is a driver of regional economic integration and Labor will take 
an active approach to its role  in the region’s economic architecture.  APEC has a key role in 
promoting economic reform behind the border throughout the Asia –Pacific region and will 
promote these efforts.  Labor will also support India’s ambition to join APEC.  Australia should 
engage in the proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia -Pacific.  
13. Labor will work to:  
a. Provide leadership to the Cairns Group and seek reductions in agricultural subsidies and 
protection;  
b. Secure reciprocal new market access for all of Australia's economic sectors;  
c. Address non -tariff 'behind the border' trade barriers such as excise tax arrangements, 
standards, customs procedures, subsidies and other restrictive measures against 
Australian exports and explore opportunities to better eliminate non -tariff barriers to 
trade unfairly erected to hinder Australian exports whilst ensuring legitimate barriers to 
defend Australians, Australian industry and the environment are not undermined;  
d. Reduce the costs to business of engaging in trade and taking part in global value chai ns 
through trade facilitation reforms;
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
90 
 
 
e. Reduce the cost to business of accessing preferential treatment under bilateral trade 
agreements by ensuring such agreements have standardised and minimal administrative 
burden country of origin and other rules ; and 
f. Overcoming non -tariff barriers is one of the most significant ways that market access and 
trade for Australian exporters can be increased.  Labor will establish a cross -agency team 
with officers from the DFAT, Austrade and the Departments of Industry an d Agriculture 
to help Australian exporters tackle non -tariff barriers to trade.  
14. Labor will ensure Australians are informed about trade negotiations and will undertake full 
community consultation before entering new agreements.  The provision of public updat es will 
follow each round of negotiations.  Where feasible, draft texts will also be released.  
15. Labor will establish a subcommittee of the Australian Labor Advisory Committee (ALAC) to 
provide a direct voice from the labour movement to relevant Members of Pa rliament on trade 
policy.  
16. Labor will legislate to ensure transparency in trade through:  
a. An initial preliminary national interest assessment is tabled in Parliament on commencing 
negotiations for any trade agreement, setting out priorities and objectives, i ncluding 
independent assessments of the economic, employment, regional, social, cultural, 
regulatory and environmental impacts;  
b. Industry, unions and community groups are consulted during trade negotiations on draft 
negotiating texts, proposals and requests  for review and comment through the 
establishment of an Accredited Advisors program based on the ‘Cleared Advisors’ 
program in the United States where after each round of negotiations DFAT will provide 
them with the draft text in order to provide real time  feedback;  
c. Material is tabled in Parliament once any negotiation is complete, including the proposed 
treaty and any legislation required to implement the treaty domestically and a debate is 
allowed on treaty text as well as implementing legislation;  
d. An Ind ependent National Interest Assessment which includes a comprehensive social, 
economic and regional impact assessment is made of the negotiated treaty text, to inform 
parliamentary debate, community discussion and Joint Standing Committee on Treaties 
consid eration of the treaty;  
e. Independent evaluation of free trade agreements takes place ten years after ratification 
to determine the impact of any agreement; and  
f. Australian submissions and materials relevant to free trade agreement negotiations and 
the World T rade Organisation are made public, unless there are commercial -in-
confidence reasons, or disclosure would damage the national interest . 
17. Labor will ensure:  
a. The role of the Parliament in trade negotiations is strengthened by the expansion of the 
role of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) . Before negotiations on a new 
trade agreement the Government’s Statement of Objectives will be submitted to the
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
91 
 
 
Committee for consideration and feedback . At the end of each round of negotiations DFAT 
will be req uired to brief the Committee;  
b. Developments at the World Trade Organisation, and the positions a Labor Government 
takes there, are regularly reported to Parliament through the Joint Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and Accredited Tra de Advisors’ are provided the 
means and opportunity to provide real time feedback during negotiations;  
c. Consultative mechanisms are open to, and representative of business, unions, and 
environmental and community interests . Consultation will not be used to enable unethical 
practices or to shield unscrupulous behaviour in shaping trade outcomes;  
d. The composition of delegations to World Trade Organisation Ministerial meetings is 
reviewed so they include appropriate representation from business, unions and non -
government organisations; and  
e. World Trade Organisation rule changes are advanced to ensure immediate publication of 
dispute settlement decisions, together with short, plain language explanations . 
18. Labor will better utilise Australia's rights under multilater al agreements to defend Australian 
jobs and interests from unfair trade . A strong and effective trade remedies system should 
ensure overseas exporters do not engage in unfair and predatory trade practices and injure 
Australian manufacturers, growers and fo od processors, or undermine jobs . Labor will continue 
to strengthen Australia's anti -dumping laws and ensure that the Anti -Dumping Commission has 
adequate resources to enable thorough, timely and accurate investigations, compliance by 
exporters and importe rs, and rigorous enforcement of anti -dumping measures . Labor will have 
a zero tolerance approach to the circumvention or avoidance of duties or their intent and be 
vigilant in overcoming this behaviour . Labor will also look to streamline 'Review of Measure s' 
and 'Duty Assessment' processes to ensure that the correct amount of duty is collected and paid 
including, where necessary, retrospectively . Labor supports the provision of independent advice 
and assistance for small and medium -sized Australian enterpri ses and producers . 
19. Australia's anti -dumping system should reflect and act on international developments and 
exporter behaviour and should not lag behind comparable countries.  Australian firms, 
particularly SMEs, need help including expertise and informatio n such as import data.  Access to 
import data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics is vital for manufacturers and producers 
seeking the imposition of anti -dumping measures by the Anti -Dumping Commission.  It is also 
important for the assessment by Austra lian industry of the effectiveness of measures imposed 
by the Anti -Dumping Commission, particularly in enabling the identification of noncompliance 
or circumvention of those measures.  Labor in government will amend the Census and Statistics 
Act to improve access to trade and import data held by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  
20. Labor will ensure the International Trade Remedies Forum and the Anti -Dumping Review Panel 
is appropriately resourced and is comprised of industry representatives where appropriate or 
those with experience in industry in order to effectively deliver their important functions.  Labor 
will transfer the responsibility for Safeguards investigations from the Productivity Commission 
to the Anti -Dumping Commission consistent with  international best practice.  Labor will also 
continue to maintain Ministerial discretion to determine if duties are in the public interest and 
not impose a test.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
92 
 
 
21. Labor will in Government direct the International Trade Remedies Forum to investigate the new  
Trade Defence Instrument enacted by European Commission and do a gap analysis between 
their and Australia’s approach including in relation to considering how non -compliance with 
international labour standards impact reasonable costs for the purpose of nor mal value 
determination in anti -dumping investigations and how distorted costs should subsequently be 
replaced with benchmark costs in this situation.  The Forum will be directed to provide advice 
on any updates required to the Anti -Dumping and Subsidies Ma nual and/or the relevant 
sections of the Customs Act with the view of clarifying current approaches to these matters by 
the Anti -Dumping Commission and, where required and appropriate, harmonising the Anti -
Dumping Commissions approach with the new approach  of the European Commission.  
22. Consumers have the right to know that imported products meet Australian standards for safety 
and quality.  Labor will develop, fund and support an intelligence -led, risk -based approach to 
standards compliance assurance on import ed products.  This will include new and invigorated 
processes for sampling, testing, labelling and penalties for false and misleading conduct 
regarding claims to adherence to regulation and standards.  Appropriate governance and 
regulatory mechanisms will be  formed through consultation with governments, unions, industry 
and other stakeholders.  
23. Over 40 million people worldwide are trapped in some form of modern slavery, many of whom 
are victims of exploitation in global supply chains.  Australia has an importan t role to play in 
abolishing modern slavery.  Modern slavery is a hidden problem that will not be discovered 
without meaningful attempts to expose it. Labor will ensure that Commonwealth criminal laws 
adequately capture, and prohibit, forced labour. This in cludes forced labour in shipping, ﬁshing, 
clothing, food production, domestic work and other high -risk sectors.  Labor will enforce supply 
chain reporting requirements, including mandatory reporting requirements and penalties for 
non-compliance.  Labor will also establish an Independent Anti -Slavery Commissioner to lead 
our efforts to abolish modern slavery in Australia and abroad.  
24. Increased international trade brings with it the responsibility to promote higher labour 
standards for Australia and internationa lly. Labor will support greater cooperation between the 
World Trade Organisation and International Labour Organisation secretariats on trade and 
enforceable labour standards.  Labor supports and promotes the incorporation of enforceable 
core ILO Conventions  and labour standards, as a minimum, in all international trade 
agreements.  Labor in government will require the inclusion of enforceable reciprocal 
obligations for countries to adopt and maintain in their laws internationally recognized labour 
principles,  as stated in ILO conventions in bilateral agreements and should be included in multi -
lateral agreements.  Labor will outlaw importation into Australia of goods or services produced 
with forced labour and child labour or prison labour.  Labor will work again st forced, prison and 
child labour.  
25. An investment priority for Australia’s aid program will be raising international labour standards 
and capacity building for unions working abroad.  Labor will promote ethical standards including 
higher labour standards an d sustainable development in all aid programs, including through the 
provision of legal and economic expertise as well as capacity building for national and industry 
level unions.  Labor will use all possible diplomatic efforts to build human rights and soc ial justice 
outcomes into trade policy.  Labor is strongly committed to promoting international labour 
standards and enhancing the capacity of unions abroad.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
93 
 
 
26. Labor supported communities participating in the forestry, timber and forest products sector s 
with legislation and regulations to prohibit the importation of illegally logged wood and forest 
products made from it.  Labor will ensure that importers comply with the Legislation and 
Regulations by taking a risk -based approach to monitoring due diligence syst ems to ensure 
imported products are not derived from illegal sources.   
27. Labor will not allow trade agreements to limit the capacity of the Australian Government to 
determine immigration policies that promote education and training, permanent rather than 
temporary migration, local employment and fair employment standards.  Labor will ensure 
future trade agreements do not prevent Australia from effectively regulating temporary 
migration, including by requiring genuine labour market testing for temporary work  visas as 
well as Australian market wages and employment rights for immigrant workers where genuine 
skills shortages are deemed to exist.  Labor will ensure trade agreements promote recruitment 
of local labour and protect the wages and conditions of local w orkers.  Labor will not ratify 
agreements which waive labour market testing and will renegotiate clauses in current 
agreements which do.  
28. Labor recognises that trade agreements should not be used to undermine Australian working 
conditions and foreign workers  should only be used in situations where specific skills shortages 
are present and only for the period it takes to train and develop the capacity of an Australian to 
do the job.  
29. Labor recognises that the varied definition of contractual service suppliers a nd waiver of labour 
market testing in free trade agreements has undermined Australia’s immigration system.  Labor 
will ensure that the definition of contractual service suppliers is reviewed to be consistent 
across all free trade agreements to ensure consis tency in applying labour market testing to 
protect Australian jobs.  
30. Trade agreements should not enable the degradation of public services and must not inhibit the 
right of Australian governments to regulate and re -regulate in the national interest.  
31. Labor w ill guarantee the protection of access to affordable medicines for all Australians by 
ensuring that third parties cannot unduly influence the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Advisory Committee, or the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schem e. Trade and 
investment agreements must not extend the monopolies on medicines by extending either the 
patent or the data exclusivity periods of medicines or biologics (such as cancer and 
immunotherapy drugs).  
32. Labor supports the principle of national treat ment so foreign and domestic companies are 
treated equally under the law.  Labor does not support the inclusion of provisions in trade 
agreements that confer legal rights on foreign businesses that are not available to domestic 
businesses.  Nor does Labor su pport the inclusion of provisions such as investor state dispute 
settlement clauses that constrain the ability of government to make laws on social, 
environmental, labour and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not 
discriminate between do mestic and foreign businesses.  These undermine fair competition, 
judicial independence and the Australian people’s sovereign right to legislate and implement 
policies in their interest through democratic processes.  As such, Labor views these provisions 
as contrary to the national interest and basic principles of democratic sovereignty and will not
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
94 
 
 
accept such clauses in any trade agreements.  Labor will not ask this of Australia’s trading 
partners in future trade agreements.  
33. Australia is a party to Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clauses through existing trade 
and investment agreements.  Labor in government will review ISDS provisions in existing trade 
and investment agreements and seek to work with Australia’s trading partners to remove these 
provisi ons.  While this process is underway, Labor will work with the international community 
to reform ISDS tribunals so they remove perceived conflicts of interest by temporary appointed 
judges, adhere to precedents and include appeal mechanisms.  
34. Labor will set up a full time negotiating team within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
whose sole job will be to negotiate the removal of ISDS clauses and the reinstatement of labour 
market testing where it has been waived in trade agreements to ensure those a greements are 
consistent with Australian laws and regulations, including applicable Australian workplace law, 
work safety law and relevant Australian licensing, regulation and certification standards laws 
and regulations.  The Team will be required to brief  Accredited Advisers on the status of these 
negotiations and the Accredited Advisers will be provided the means and opportunity to provide 
real time feedback during negotiations.  
35. Labor supports current World Trade Organisation rules that allow all nations to determine for 
themselves the appropriate public -private mix in their health, education, water and welfare 
sectors and the distribution of government funding within these sectors, and to protect their 
cultural industries, and procurement and employment p olicies.  Labor will vigorously oppose any 
trade proposals that would require Australia to privatise its public services including its health, 
education or welfare sectors, undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, reduce 
government rights to determine the distribution of funding within the above sectors, or remove 
protection for our cultural industries.  Labor will oppose attempts to privatise water services 
under World Trade Organisation rules.  Federal, state, territory and local governments should 
retain the power to implement policies to encourage industry development, research and 
development, regional development and appropriate environmental, employment and 
procurement standards.  Labor will ensure ethical Government procurement requirements and 
prac tices for all Government spending and contracting is adhered to.  
36. In Government, Labor will increase the capacity of unions to assist in the lifting of global labour 
standards to protect workers’ rights in Australia and abroad.  We need to do more in our reg ion 
to increase the capacity of unions to organise workers, protect vulnerable people from 
exploitation, lead and advocate public policy and work with foreign governments – both through 
the International Labour Organisation and global and regional organisat ion and forums to lift 
labour standards.  
37. Australian unions have a proud record of fighting to protect working people in partnership with 
those in our region.  Labor will support programs that enhance and resource the ability of unions 
to: 
a. Promote and suppor t core ILO rights, including freedom of association, collective 
bargaining, elimination of forced, compulsory and child labour and the elimination of 
discrimination;
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
95 
 
 
b. Capacity build, deliver education and enhance leader development for unions and 
organisati ons working abroad;  
c. Advocate to raise awareness and build platforms for change on global issues impacting 
working people;  
d. Promote worker to worker links within multi -national corporations and their supply 
chains;  
e. Monitor and assist in the enforcement of clauses in labour chapters in trade agreements 
(where they exist);  
f. Engage with temporary foreign workers, including pre -departure to Australia wherever 
feasible;  
g. To conduct compliance work regarding labour standards in supply chains; and  
h. Wor k with other nations and domestic unions to strengthen labour standards, workers’ 
rights, occupational health and safety standards and gender equality.  
38. Labor will:  
a. Increase fairness and transparency in global supply chains including by targeting 
exploitati ve practices and by implementing ethical Government procurement 
requirements and practices for all Government spending and contracting;  
b. Work with other nations to strengthen institutions to protect labour standards, workers’ 
rights, occupational health and  safety standards and gender equality; and  
c. Require ethical labour standards for all companies that receive government financial 
assistance including in their supply chains . These efforts will be a crucial part of our 
international efforts to negotiate and enforce (where applicable) labour chapters as part 
of trade agreements – seeing positive action on the ground and advocacy in regional and 
multi -lateral forums . 
39. Labor will not support the expansion of intellectual property rights in a way which would exten d 
monopoly patent rights to charge higher prices and would give copyright holders greater rights 
at the expense of consumers.  
40. The development assistance Australia provides under the World Trade Organisation’s aid -for-
trade initiative should support develop ing countries in establishing skills, infrastructure, 
regulatory and investment policies to support sustainable growth.  We will deliver practical 
trade -related capacity building programs that promote workers’ rights and improve the ability 
of developing na tions to export, improve their international competitiveness, and engage with 
the global economy.  
41. Labor recognises that trade is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to promote economic 
growth in developing countries.  We want nations throughout the w orld to benefit from open 
markets and share in global growth.  Labor will promote policies to achieve this in the World 
Trade Organisation, through trade agreements, at the World Bank, the International Monetary 
Fund, the International Labour Organisation a nd other international forums.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
96 
 
 
42. Increased international trade brings the responsibility to promote higher environmental 
standards for Australia and internationally.  Labor is committed to sustainable development.  
Labor will work to remove environmentally dam aging subsidies, and promote mechanisms that 
balance the interests of environmental protection and open markets.  
43. Australia has an important role and responsibility at the Asian Development Bank.  Labor 
supports the inclusion of core labour standards in its decision -making, including the roles 
monitoring mechanism at the Asian Development Bank.  
44. The Asian Development Bank's Safeguard Policy prohibits investments that include the 
"production of trade in or use of unbonded asbestos fibres".  However, this does no t apply to 
the purchase and use of bonded asbestos cement sheeting where the asbestos content is less 
than 20%.  This in effect means an exemption by the bank for almost all bonded asbestos 
containing materials used in the construction sector.  Under Labor t he Australian Government 
will lobby for a change in policy to end of the use of asbestos in Asian Development Bank 
financed projects.  
Uranium  
1. The production of uranium and its use in the nuclear fuel cycle present unique and unprecedented 
hazards and risks , including:  
a. Threats to human health and the local environment in the mining and milling of uranium 
and management of radioactive materials, which demand the enforcement of strict safety 
procedures;  
b. The generation of products that are usable as the raw mat erials for nuclear weapons 
manufacture, which demands the enforcement of eﬀective controls against diversion; and  
c. The generation of highly toxic radioactive waste by -products that demand permanently 
safe disposal methods.  
2. Labor accordingly will allow the m ining and export of uranium only under the most stringent 
conditions.  
3. In relation to mining and milling, Labor will:  
a. Ensure the safety of workers in the uranium industry is given priority. Labor has 
established a compulsory register for workers in the uranium industry that includes 
regular health checks and ongoing monitoring. The register is held by an independent 
agency and will be subject to privacy provisions;  
b. Ensure Australian uranium mining, milling and rehabilitation is based on world best 
practi ce standards, extensive continuing research on environmental impacts and the 
health and safety of employees and aﬀected communities, particularly Indigenous 
communities;  
c. Ensure the Australian public is informed about the quality of the environmental 
perfor mance of uranium mines through public accountability mechanisms;
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
97 
 
 
d. Foster a constructive relationship between mining companies and Indigenous 
communities aﬀected by uranium mining; and  
e. Prohibit the mining of uranium within national parks under International Union for 
Conservation of Nature protected area category 1A, category 1B, and category 2, and 
listed world heritage areas.  
4. In relation to exports other than to India, Labor will allow the export of uranium only to those 
countries that observe the Nuclear N on-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), are committed to non-
proliferation  policies, and have ratiﬁed international and bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements. 
Labor will export uranium only to countries that maintain strict safeguards and security controls 
over t heir nuclear power industries.  
5. In relation to India, an important strategic partner for Australia, commitments and responsible 
actions in support of nuclear non -proliferation, consistent with international guidelines on nuclear 
supply, will provide an acce ptable basis for peaceful nuclear cooperation, including the export of 
uranium, subject to the application of strong safeguards.  
6. In addition, Labor will work towards:  
a. Strengthening export control regimes and the rights and authority of the International 
Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA);  
b. Appropriate international responses to violations of existing safeguard commitments;  
c. Limiting the processing of weapon usable material (separation of plutonium and high 
enriched uranium in civilian programs);  
d. Tightening controls over the export of nuclear material and technology;  
e. Universalising of the IAEA additional protocol making it mandatory for all states and 
members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to adhere to the additional protocol as a 
condition of supply to all their tran sfers;  
f. Criminalising actions of individuals and companies that assist in nuclear proliferation;  
g. The development of an international guarantee of nuclear fuel supply to states foregoing 
sensitive nuclear technologies;  
h. Revising the NPT to prevent countries from withdrawing from the NPT and passing a new 
resolution in the United Nations Security Council addressing the penalties for withdrawal 
from the NPT;  
i. Encouraging all nuclear states to join the NPT;  
j. Reserving the right to withhold supplies of ur anium permanently, indeﬁnitely or for a 
speciﬁed period from  any country  that ceases  to observe  the non-proliferation  safeguards  
and security  conditions  applied  to Australian uranium exports to that country, or which 
adopts nuclear practices or policies th at do not further  advance  the cause  of nuclear  non-
proliferation ; 
k. Supporting the maintenance and enhancement of international and Australian safeguards 
to ensure that  uranium mined in Australia, and nuclear products derived from it, are used 
only for civil  purposes by  approved instrumentalities in approved countries that are
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
98 
 
 
signatories to the NPT (with the exception of India)  and with  whom  Australia  has 
safeguard  arrangements;  and 
l. Seeking  adequate  international  resourcing  of the IAEA  to ensure  its eﬀective ness  in 
undertaking  its charter.  
7. Labor will progress these commitments through diplomatic means including the re -establishment 
of the Canberra Commission to re -invigorate Australia’s  tradition of middle power, multilateral 
diplomacy. In doing so, Labor believes that as a non -nuclear armed  nation and a good international 
citizen, Australia can make a signiﬁcant contribution to promoting disarmament, the reduction of 
nuclear stockpiles, and the responsible use of nuclear technology.  
8. Labor will:  
a. Vigorously and totally oppose the ocean dumping of radioactive waste;  
b. Prohibit the establishment of nuclear power plants and all other stages of the nuclear fuel 
cycle in Australia;  
c. Fully meet all Australia’s  obligations as a party to the NPT; and  
d. Remain strongly opposed to the importation and s torage of nuclear waste that is sourced 
from overseas in Australia.  
9. Labor acknowledges that radioactive waste management is a complex policy challenge that 
requires the highest levels of transparency and evidence, while balancing the need of the 
community  to beneﬁt from treatments for diseases like cancer. Accordingly, Labor will act in 
accordance with scientiﬁc evidence, and with full transparency, broad public input and best 
practice technical and consultative standards, taking into account the views of traditional owners, 
to progress responsible radioactive waste management.  
A country that makes  things  
1. Labor will rebuild Australian manufacturing. The deindustrialisation of Australia’s  regions and 
suburbs has had devastating social and economic consequenc es, squandered new growth and 
investment opportunities and hollow ed o ut Australia’s  economic capability.  
2. Shortages and supply -chain interruptions caused by the COVID -19 pandemic have shown that 
Australia urgently needs a strong, growing and diverse manufac turing industry. Being able to 
produce or guarantee access to the goods that its citizens and businesses need is the cornerstone 
of a resilient Australian economy, society and nation state.  
3. Labor will ensure Australia ’s supply of vital goods like food, med icines, water, communications, 
energy , personal protective equipment (PPE)  and other necessities required by a modern 
economy is secure from disruption and overseas dependence.  
4. To have a vibrant and sophisticated economy, Australia must have a thriving and  innovative 
manufacturing sector. Australia’s  unrivalled resource and energy endowments should mean we 
should a country with a booming manufacturing industry.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
99 
 
 
5. Labor will work to rebuild, modernise and diversify Australian manufacturing with an active 
appro ach to government programs, collaboration with industry, unions and institutions at the 
sectoral level and supporting industrial development, particularly in regional Australia. Labor will 
invest in sustainable manufacturing, and in particular those new te chnologies which will enable 
Australian industry and Australian workers to gear up for the future.  
6. Labor will work to create a future for Australia’s  industrial capacity in strategically important areas. 
Labor will develop a plan for industries that must b e secured, expanded or created. As part of this, 
Labor will assess which products, capabilities and items must be produced domestically, stored 
strategically or sourced from reliable partners.  
7. This plan should have a focus on securing jobs in suburban and regional Australia and should also 
build upon existing areas of production where Australia is already globally competitive.  
8. Labor acknowledges that Australia ’s industry policy has failed to achieve this vision.  
9. High energy prices and poor quality trade agr eements continue to undermine existing industry, a 
weak procurement framework is failing to support new industries and innovation ecosystems are 
poorly developed.  
10. Labor will employ a variety of means to provide a stronger future for Australian manufacturin g. 
These measures will include:  
a. supporting the transition to modern clean forms of energy to deliver aﬀordable, reliable 
energy to Australian industry;  
b. the continuing use of research and development tax incentives;  
c. procurement policies;  
d. fostering collabor ation between industries and research institutions; and  
e. supporting Buy Australia programs.  
11. Labor believes that in its role as a major purchaser of goods and services, government can play a 
part in fostering Australian industries, particularly emerging industries or companies. Labor will 
promote a procurement strategy to safeguard and grow skills , investment and jobs within our 
existing international obligations which allow for, amongst other things, any form of preference 
to beneﬁt small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This procurement strategy will have processes 
free of corruption and discrimina tion, lead on sustainability and ethical procurement practices, 
and ensure that robust and objective public interest tests occur in all cases. Our procurement 
strategies will support the growth of a strong First Nations people business sector.  
Sector Plans  
12. Labor acknowledges the unique challenges facing many important sectors within our 
manufacturing industry. In recognition of this, tailored approaches will be developed to assist 
these important sources of jobs, investment and innovation.  
13. Automotive : Labor notes the massive failure of policy by the LNP and the consequent 
abandonment of workers and their communities which arose from the closure of Australia’s  car
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
100 
 
 
assembly plants. The vehicle industry provides a solid base for R&D, innovation, skills and  jobs 
strategies in any digital technology strategy. Acknowledging this, Labor will work with suitable 
investment organisations to create a space for a revitalized vehicle industry in this country.  
14. Labor will work with investors, businesses, R&D organisati ons and unions which work in the 
existing vehicle components sector to develop and maintain vehicle markets as a ﬁrst term Labor 
government initiative. In addition, Labor will work to develop a domestic decarbonized vehicle 
industry strategy across the co untry comprising electric vehicles utilising the latest in digital 
technology.  
15. Defence and Shipbuilding:  Labor recognises the importance of strong, viable Australian defence 
and shipbuilding industries. Labor notes the strong bipartisan commitment to our na val 
shipbuilding requirement and will work with employers and unions to ensure that this remains an 
important part of our defence and manufacturing posture.  
16. Labor will support domestic manufacturers to engage in global defence manufacturing supply 
chains.  Labor is committed to ensuring a sovereign capability to support the ADF and will ensure 
that the vessels built for the RAN and assets produced for the ADF are, to the greatest extent 
possible, designed, built, maintained and sustained by skilled Australi an workers.  
17. Steel and aluminium:  Labor recognises the steel and aluminium industries maintain an integral 
role in Australia’s  industrial economy. This includes in the downstream value add from Australia’s  
rich resources, the supply of heavy metals to overse as markets and the domestic building 
materials industry, and to the economies of our regional communities. The steel and aluminium 
industries also play a critical demand and supply -side role in the National Electricity Market, and 
in the training and devel opment of skilled trade labour in Australia.  
18. Chemicals and fertilizers:  Labor recognises the chemicals and fertilizers industries play an 
irreplaceable role in critical Australian industries, particularly in the food, fuel and resource 
sectors. Speciﬁcally , this includes servicing the agricultural activities of Australia contributing both 
to exports and domestic food supply and the packaging of all perishable and non -perishable 
goods. This also includes the role it plays in ensuring our fuel reﬁning industr y remains 
competitive.  
19. Building materials  and products : Australia’s  infrastructure spend per capita is world -leading, 
underpinned by the biggest resource industries in the world, and the growth of urban population 
centres across our coastal regions. Labor ’s approach will see the building materials industry play 
a critical role in ensuring Australia ’s construction and infrastructure industries use Australian - 
made products, to the beneﬁt of the domestic economy. This includes cement, glass, asphalt, 
downstre am aluminium, steel and copper, timber and wood products, windows and doors, 
furnishings and blinds, carpets, cabinetry, joinery, geotextiles industries and more.  
20. Agriculture:  Labor recognises Australia’s  agriculture industry provides a diversity to our ec onomic 
exports, provides critical independence to our national food supply, and is a hallmark of the 
national identity. Horticulture and downstream processing of food -related products such as wine 
and beer also continue to be important growth industries.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
101 
 
 
21. Rail: Australia has a proud history of producing our own trains and rolling stock. This is reﬂected 
in the many Australian -built trains currently on our networks. However, this area of signiﬁcant 
market share has been continually eroded by short -term decisi ons which have led to the loss of 
signiﬁcant rail manufacturing capacity.  
22. Labor will work with state governments and other users (including the mining industry) to enhance 
the productive capacity of Australian train manufacturers. Utilising the best and sa fest technology 
available combined with the most innovative manufacturing techniques and components, 
Australian -made trains will once again be the world’s  best in passenger and freight transport.  
23. Medical technology:  Australians are justiﬁably proud of our strong performance in the medical 
ﬁeld. Eight of the  16 Nobel Prizes awarded to Australians have been in medicine. The 
accompaniment to this has been the equally  strong application of Australian knowhow to medical 
technology. In areas such as the treatment  of hearing, sleep  disorders, and life -saving medicines, 
Australia has been a world leader. Unfortunately, under the current  Government this advantage 
has been let go, with Australians ﬁnding to their dismay that we could not even  manufacture 
enough basic  surgical  masks during the  pandemic to  satisfy hospital  demand,  let alone the needs  
of the general population. To remedy this, Labor in government will work with industry, 
researchers and research  institutions, workers and their unions with the aim of  increasing self -
suﬃciency in fundamental medical equipment,  including face masks and other protective 
equipment like gloves, surgical and isolation gowns, as well as  ventilators, beds, sterilization 
equipment, etc. Operating through innovative partnership s with industry, Labor will  leverage 
Australia's current productive capacity in the medical equipment industry and develop techniques 
and products to deal with current and future needs, as well as developing new products at the 
edge of innovation to help k eep Australians safe and well.  
24. Textile , Clothing and Footwear (TCF):  Beneﬁts of local TCF manufacturing include that it 
minimises the risks that are associated with global supply chains. Several local businesses already 
trade on the strong branding and rep utation of Australian -made products in both domestic and 
export markets. There are further opportunities for the sector in supplying defence industries, 
fashion, medical and general PPE, workwear and TCF commercial furnishing markets. Drivers of 
change to the TCF industry and TCF markets in Australia have seen increasing adaptation and the 
entrance of specialised and niche product manufacturing with design and quality becoming a key 
area of competitive advantage. Coinciding with these changes has been an in creasing trend 
toward ethical consumerism. There needs to be a growth plan for the TCF industry and Labor will 
assist in building collaboration by engaging with employers and unions within the diﬀerent 
sectoral groups across the local industry and consider  the tripartite roundtable model of 
engagement which has been adopted by the Victorian Government for the sector.  
25. Food:  Australia has a justiﬁable reputation as a source of high -quality foods and beverages. Clean, 
green and environmentally sustainable, Australia’s  food industry has enjoyed signiﬁcant success 
in creating and servicing export markets around the world. Labor will work with food industry 
companies, workers, and their unions to grow the sector and develop technology to create new 
products aimed at enhancing Australia’s  leading position as the worlds food bowl in a carbon -
constrained world.  
26. Pulp , Paper  and Fibre:  The PPF industry has been a mainstay of Australian manufacturing,
constrained world.  
26. Pulp , Paper  and Fibre:  The PPF industry has been a mainstay of Australian manufacturing, 
especially in regional Australia, since federation. To ensure a future  for this vital industry, and the
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
102 
 
 
communities that rely on it, Australia will help this industry to continue on its current path towards 
a sustainable future. In government, Labor will develop procurement guidelines which encourage 
the purchase of Australi an-made paper and boxes. Labor will also support our domestic industry 
to develop new packaging materials , bioproducts  and production methods in partnership 
between local industry, researchers and institutions including CSIRO.  
27. Timber and wood products:  Labor recognises that the timber and wood products industry is an 
important employer in regional Australia and that timber production and harvesting has a 
comparatively low carbon footprint. Timber and wood products are a carbon sequestering and 
renewable sou rce of products vital for domestic housing construction. Timber, along with 
innovative products manufactured in newer and emerging industry sub -sectors, carbon ﬁbre 
wood laminates and other engineered wood products provide sustainable options which can 
improve the associated carbon emissions performance of commercial construction and 
infrastructure projects. Labor in Government will work with industry, unions, researchers and 
communities to boost and improve research and development, resource security, skil ls 
development and the take up of innovation in the timber and wood products industry.  
28. Energy and Renewables:  The Australian Labor Party has a long history of supporting the 
renewables sector. While the sector has matured in recent years, it still enjoys s igniﬁcant growth 
as state governments, industry and communities embrace the transition to clean energy.  
29. As the percentage of our energy that is created through renewable sources continues to increase, 
we must do more to ensure that we deliver the full economic beneﬁt of this transition.  
30. Labor will ensure that new renewable energy projects – design, engineering, manufacturing, 
installation, commissioning, servicing and maintenance – support good quality, local jobs. The 
most important economic factor of any procurement process is the local jobs it has the capacity 
to create. Therefore, a future Labor government will implement policies to maximise and require 
locally manufactured content on future renewable energy projects. This will  help create long -term 
jobs in the renewable sector whilst providing new jobs for workers in the energy sector. A future 
Labor government will work in conjunction with the relevant unions to create a vibrant and 
sustainable manufacturing industry in the renewable energy sector.  Australia has the skills and 
the capacity to become a renewable energy powerhouse  – let’s make it here.  
31. Mining:  Australia has gained signiﬁcant wealth from its mineral resources, but we have not done 
enough to capitalise on our global leadership in this se ctor. Australia should not just be a leader 
in the user of cutting -edge mining technology, we should be a leading exporter of it as well. Labor 
will develop a comprehensive plan to ensure that we build on our strength and expertise in mining 
technology and  develop a domestic manufacturing industry to support it.  
32. Australia also enjoys a signiﬁcant competitive advantage due the large quantity of key minerals 
like lithium and rare earth minerals. Rather than exporting these highly sought -after commodities, 
we should be developing a manufacturing industry around them and creating good quality, skilled 
jobs in regional areas. Labor will develop these new industries and ensure tha t the Australian 
Made stamp is seen on high quality, high tech goods that are shipped  all around the world.

Financial services  
A Professional Financial Services Industry  
1. Labor acknowledges that our ﬁnancial services sector is a major employing sector in our economy 
providing signiﬁcant employment and career opportunities for around half a million Australians, 
now and into the future.  
2. Labor also recognises that businesses, and the Australian community in general, are compelled to 
participate daily in our ﬁnancial services sector. A comprehensive, professional, eﬃcient and 
competitive industry is essential to allocating capital in the economy and our essential services 
such as banking, insurance and superannuation.  
3. It is in the national interest to ensure that Australia’s  ﬁnance industry has comprehensive local 
capability to meet the ne eds of both the domestic and global economies. The strength of our 
regulatory regime, together with eﬀective competition policy and consumer protections will 
ensure our ﬁnance sector has the best chance to make its full contribution to national wellbeing, 
as well as providing a platform for growth in the export of ﬁnancial services to our region and the 
world.  
4. We want Australia to become a ﬁnancial services centre in the region and will continue to 
undertake the necessary reforms to achieve this. That means  we need to foster a professional, 
eﬃcient, ethical and innovative marketplace for ﬁnancial services and investment in employment, 
technology and skill development across the sector.  
Financial Services Industry Plan  
5. Australia needs a ﬁnancial services indu stry plan that focuses on innovation and on identifying 
capabilities in the Australian economy for developing a globally competitive and traded ﬁnancial 
services sector. This industry plan should include strategies to:  
a. Develop stronger links between univer sities, business and industry bodies, training 
institutions, unions, and the federal and state governments;  
b. Improve skills through training, especially through an expanded and restored TAFE sector, 
and other relevant skills development initiatives;  
c. Encoura ge leaders who are capable of building a globally competitive and productive 
sector;  
d. Invest in infrastructure that will allow Australian industry to be globally competitive;  
e. Leverage the roll out of the NBN to build competitiveness and productivity and to  
strengthen the regional job market;  
f. Increase capabilities in data management;  
g. Extend market links to the global ﬁnancial services sector;  
h. Attract investment by companies that can build an international presence for Australia 
and promote Australia’s  key ca pabilities in the ﬁnancial services sector.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
104 
 
 
6. Oﬀ-shoring of ﬁnancial service sector jobs has been emerging as an important issue impacting 
employees and communities for a number of years. The COVID -19 pandemic has further 
exacerbated underlying risks. The business continuity arrangements for large ﬁnan cial services 
organisations, and data protection for consumers, have both been exposed to the serous risks 
entailed in oﬀshoring critical functions.  
7. Labor believes that all Australian ﬁnancial service sector employers have a responsibility to 
support and p romote new and better Australian jobs, creating opportunities for local 
employment. Labor supports policies that promote Australia as a ﬁnancial services centre and 
Labor supports those Australian ﬁnancial services businesses who create and promote Austral ian 
jobs. Labor believes that oﬀshoring ﬁnancial services sector jobs undermines our capacity to 
develop and maintain a safe, eﬃcient, comprehensive, sustainable and internationally 
competitive local industry, and therefore believes oﬀshoring is not in the  national  interest.  
Competitive and sustainable banking system  
8. Labor promotes a competitive and sustainable banking system for all. Australians are compelled 
to participate in the ﬁnance sector and as such the industry bears national economic and social 
signiﬁcance. The banking industry must provide its products and services transparently and 
responsibly, balancing the needs of consumers, employees, shareholders and the economy. Our 
banks are highly proﬁtable compared to their overseas counterparts, and Lab or expects them to 
continue supporting the communities in which they operate.  
9. Labor continues to support the four pillar s policy. The four big banks continue to dominate our 
domestic banking environment and any move to merge these entities would severely c ompromise 
competition and be detrimental for consumers, local jobs, services and the economy.  
10. We believe vigorous competition underpinned by ethical practices, prudent supervision, 
consumer protection and transparency is the best way to get a better deal f or families and create 
a system that oﬀers real choice for consumers and businesses. Combined with a strong prudential 
supervision and other regulation, this approach will continue to greatly beneﬁt both the ﬁnancial 
services sector and the consumers, and ensure that important reforms such as the Future of 
Financial Advice are pursued to the beneﬁt of all Australians.  
11. Labor recognises the structural changes in the ﬁnance sector arising from the digitalisation, 
artiﬁcial intelligence and automation. Labor no tes the speed and scale of these changes, and their 
impact on employees.  
12. Labor supports the establishment of a tripartite (Government, employer, employee) Finance Skills 
Consultation Committee to establish and oversee training and accreditation in the ﬁnan ce sector, 
in order to position workers for the ﬁnance jobs of the future.  The Terms of Reference for this 
committee:  
a. skills accreditation;  
b. the portability of skills and qualiﬁcations;  
c. a scalable, pathways -based approach to training; and
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
105 
 
 
d. the importance of ethics training for all levels of staﬀ to nurture public conﬁdence in the 
sector.  
Productivity Commission  
1. Labor notes that it is twenty years since the Productivity Commission was created.  The 
Productivity Commissions processes and legislativ e functions are in a substantial need of 
modernisation.  It is time that the Commission undergoes a thorough examination to test if its 
remit, make up, statutory guidelines, structure and culture is fit for purpose, whether it is 
desirable that the Commissi on remain the principal review and advisory body to the 
Commonwealth Government and what reforms need to be undertaken to it if it is.  Therefore, a 
Labor Government will hold a root and branch review into the Productivity Commission and its 
constituting le gislation.  Labor is committed to reforming the Productivity Commission, to 
ensure that its functions and policy guidelines are fit for purpose in a time of rising inequality 
and a turbulent international trade and investment environment.  
Supporting the Aus tralian Textile Clothing and Footwear sector and ethical practices in it for the 
beneﬁt of workers  
1. The Australian Textile Clothing and Footwear (TCF) sector remains an important provider of jobs 
across many Australian cities and regional communities. The s ector provides employment for 
thousands of women and men including over 30,000 workers in the formal sector and many 
thousands more in the informal sector as home -based workers.  
2. Many workers in the sector face language barriers and cultural challenges whic h may impede 
them from obtaining alternative employment, yet possess a unique, speciﬁc, and valuable 
skillset and capability of great value to a sector which underpins key sections of the economy 
around the country.  
3. Although the local sector has faced a ch allenging transition period due to numerous and speciﬁc 
pressures presented by globalisation and increased international competition beneﬁting from 
falling barriers to access to our domestic markets, many manufacturers have remained 
committed to maintainin g Australian manufacturing operations and have taken advantage of 
the opportunity to adapt and innovate.  
4. As a key sector of the manufacturing industry, the sector provides and will continue to provide, 
important ﬂow on jobs in communities.  
5. The sector prove d critical during the COVID -19 pandemic with many local ﬁrms and their supply 
chains able to pivot to produce medical Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and face masks 
for the public when demand soared, and global supply chains broke down.  
6. There exist new  and emerging markets where locally made, ethically accredited products, as 
well as sustainably made, high quality products and unique design innovations are highly valued, 
and this presents an opportunity for local producers.  
7. Despite all the above, the TC F sector has too often been ignored by the Coalition when they 
consider Australia’s  manufacturing future.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
106 
 
 
8. The Coalition have also abdicated their responsibility to help put a stop to worker exploitation 
in the sector.  
9. They refuse to use their signiﬁcant pu rchasing power to help drive ethically, locally made 
production of TCF by Small and Medium Enterprises in the sector, nor will they reinstate critical 
funding for Ethical Clothing Australia which they slashed in 2014.  
10. This is despite that TCF workers are e specially vulnerable to exploitation, for several reasons 
including that the sector is characterised by:  
• A high proportion are mature aged migrant women, who face cultural and linguistic 
barriers to understanding  and inquiring  about their workplace  entitle ments.  
• A diﬃculty  in identifying  homeworkers/outworkers  in manufacturing  supply  chains.  
• A lack of familiarity of the homeworker/outworker provisions and 
related provisions of the Textile,  Clothing,  Footwear  and Associated  
Industries  Award  2010  (the TCF Award)  
• An unveriﬁed number of workers being homeworkers/outworkers, who work 
away from busi ness premises  (often  at home)  at the  end of long  and complex  
production  supply  chains  
• Limited  record  keeping,  compounding  the risk of worker  exploitation.  
11. Labor will support jobs, workers conditions and workplace rights in the TCF sector in recognition 
of their importance to the economy and the workers involved in the sector.  
12. Labor will address the following areas of importance to the TCF sector and the workers, families 
and communities which rely on it:  
Industry  Policy  
• Unlike the Coalition, Labor recognises the TCF sector as a vital cog of Australia’s  
manufacturing industry and advanced industrial capacity worthy of support and innovation 
assistance. Labor will ensure a tripartite approach to building the innovative capacity of 
Australian ind ustry including the TCF sector.  
• Labor recognises that in government it will be able to assist the transformation of the TCF 
sector by supporting the development of new products and processes, targeting 
opportunities in ethical production and the high -tech,  high -value end of the market including 
medical PPE.  
• The conditions of support to TCF companies will be designed to ensure sustainable 
employment outcomes, ethical labour, and environmental standards, and maintain capacity 
and build skills.  
• Labor will supp ort Australia’s  industries including the TCF sector through innovation 
programs and government procurement policies.  
• Australia has huge opportunities to expand TCF production and will work with the industry 
to attract investment and to increase access to ﬁ nance.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
107 
 
 
Ethical  Clothing  Australia  
• Labor will provide important ﬁnancial support to Ethical Clothing Australia in recognition that 
it represents a  unique, worlds best practice accreditation system which sees employers and 
unions working collaboratively to  stamp  out exploitation  in TCF supply  chains.  
• ECA accreditation serves workers well by ensuring that they are being paid appropriately, 
receiving all their  legal minimum conditions, and working in safe workplaces throughout the 
business s upply chain and serves  accredited businesses well b y ensuring they have a vehicle to 
demonstrate ethical products as a key market  diﬀerentiation point for them to capitalise upon 
the increasing preferences and requirements of procurers,  purchasers,  and consumers.  
Ethical  Procurement  
• Labor will lead on ethical procurement practices and improve opportunities for Australian TCF 
manufacturers  in government tenders and require all companies that tender for TCF contracts 
to hold Ethical Clothing  Australia  accreditation.  
• Labor will establish a TCF Ethical Procurement Register and require all companies that tender 
for Government  contracts  in the TCF sector  to hold  Ethical  Clothing  Australia  accreditation  
and be on the register.  
• Labor will require su ccessful TCF suppliers and their supply chains to remain accredited and 
be transparent to  ensure  that ethical  standards  are monitored  and met throughout  the life of 
a procurement  contract.  
Local  procurement  
• Labor will require that the purchase of locally manufactured TCF (where the required goods 
are manufactured  locally, meet all requirements of bid speciﬁcations, there is a genuine 
market, and the procurement will be  consistent  with  our international  obligations)  by all 
Government  departments  and agencies.  
• Labor will require contractors on publicly funded projects to purchase locally manufactured 
TCF from  businesses which are accredited by Ethical Clothing Australia (where the required 
goods are manufactured  locally, meet all requirements of bid s peciﬁcations, there is a genuine 
market, and the procurement will be  consistent  with  our international obligations).  
• Labor supports the lowering of the threshold for government procurers being required to 
consider the  economic beneﬁt a TCF contract provide s or clarifying that the current threshold 
can apply to an aggregated  total  procurement across  government.  
• Labor will compare the deﬁnition of Small and Medium Enterprises in Australia to the 
prevailing deﬁnition in  the United  States  and examining  any barriers  to harmonising  it. 
• Labor supports the continued manufacture of combat uniforms being in Australia and wants 
to expand  Australian made component of uniform and equipment supplies of ADF personnel 
consistent with our  international  obligations.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L

• Labor  will support the important work of Ethical Clothing Australia and work with agencies to 
extend  requirements for ethical labour standards to companies tendering for government 
contracts that source their  TCF contracts  from  oﬀshore  when  local purchasing  is not feasible.  
Outworker  Rights  
• Labor  recognises  the disadvantaged  position  of outworkers  in the TCF sector.  
• Outworkers require speciﬁc regulatory protection to control the exploitative conditions 
under which they are  employed and ensure they are deemed to be employees and receive 
all employee entitlements including  superannuation.  
Workers  Assistance  
• Labor recognises that vital support and assistance for TCF workers who lose jobs in the sector 
are provided  with appropriate support for programs and services like a non -means tested 
training allowance, training in  English language and literacy, customised support for training 
and job -seeking, and funding for community - based  organisations  to advocate  on behalf of  
redundant workers.  
Safe and secure jobs in aviation  
1. COVID -19 has demonstrated the inherent volatility of the aviation sector and vulnerability to 
external shocks, with reasonably paid secure jobs being replaced by low paid, unsafe and 
insecure jobs. Power imbalances and their impact on workers throughout the supply chain have 
been brutally highlighted. Aviation is a public good which warrants eﬀective government 
regulation, oversight, planning, investment and equity in order to create and maintain good 
Australian jobs in our cities and our regio ns and protect essential transport routes to Australian 
businesses and communities. As such a Federal Labor Government will ensure that an 
appropriate capacity exists to make binding and enforceable orders on all supply chain 
participants, including compre hensive dispute resolution mechanisms; providing ‘same job, 
same pay’ and maximising secure jobs; and the ability to inquire and make recommendations 
to Government about any issues facing the sector including through the use of fair procurement 
policy.  
Australian shipping  
1. Labor recognises that Australia needs a revitalised, strong Australian -ﬂagged shipping industry 
with a secure workforce. The nation needs a strong Australian ﬂagged ﬂeet to ensure secure 
supply of goods essential to our economy, such as fu el, as well as to ensure the safety of our 
community in times of crisis. Labor acknowledges that shipping is an important national 
strategic industry supporting many other industries such as manufacturing, energy production, 
agriculture and tourism and tha t ships are eﬃcient, require no built infrastructure for navigation 
and are the least energy intensive of all freight transport  modes.  
2. We will amend maritime laws to revitalise the Australian shipping industry with more eﬀective 
regulatory arrangements for ship licencing overseen by an industry body. We will improve 
maritime safety laws to ensure the maintenance of maritime skills and qua liﬁcations as well as 
minimum safety and crewing standards necessary for a safe shipping industry. We will establish
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
109 
 
 
a strategic ﬂeet, support development of the cruise sector including special support for the 
Australian expedition cruise sector, establish  more contemporary foreign seafarer visa 
requirements, and improved corporate and seafarer tax incentives and workforce development 
measures so Australian shipowners can compete fairly and employ more Australian seafarers. 
We will ensure Australian shippin g and port infrastructure is appropriately funded and will 
establish industry stakeholder engagement arrangements to help coordinate our commitment 
to revitalise Australian  shipping.  
3. We will establish a stronger interface and integration between commercial  shipping and Naval, 
Customs and search/rescue/salvage/emergency response requirements of government, as well 
as with appropriate government agencies and commercial shipbuilding/repair/maintenance to 
improve maritime security and help build the maritime cl uster.  
4. Labor acknowledges that new opportunities for Australian ships will emerge as industries 
transform in response to utilisation of new technologies and as Australia rebuilds its 
manufacturing industry, as energy transitions away from fossil fuel usage  adopting new energy 
sources such as hydrogen, ammonia and biofuels and as more value adding occurs in 
agriculture, all creating demand for ships in domestic and international sea transportation. 
Labor will incentivise these new opportunities for Australia n ships.  
Second Sydney airport  
2. Labor will develop an integrated Sydney Aviation Plan to provide for Sydney’s future airport 
needs.  Labor supports a second airport for Sydney to serve the needs of the region and drive 
economic activity.  Labor will ensure th e operation of a second airport improves economic 
activity and job creation in western Sydney and minimises environmental impacts, including by 
having night time fly free zones over communities.  Labor will maintain the cap and curfew at 
Kingsford Smith Air port and implement the long -term operating plan maximising take -offs over 
water.  
Safe rates  
1. A Federal Labor Government will, as a matter of urgency, legislate for a national system of 
Safe Rates consisting of an independent body with responsibility for sa fe standards of work 
including fair payments and conditions. This task has become more pressing given the 
emergence of new technology and the gig economy in passenger and freight transport which 
has accelerated the downward spiral throughout the transport industry.  The system will 
ensure implementation of the following principles:  
a. Universal application of a system of binding, enforceable and safe standards. The 
standards will cover all parties in the transport supply chain/ contract networks to ensure 
safe performance, planning and appropriate payments. The standards will focus on 
eliminating economic and contractual practices that place undue pressure on transport 
supply chains/ contract networks;  
b. Appropriate, enforceable  payments  and related  conditions  for all operators  and workers,  
regardless  of label;
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
110 
 
 
c. The capacity to resolve (including where necessary through binding decisions) transport 
supply chain/ contract networks disputes;  
d. Appropriate and adequate enforcement regime; and 
e. Appropriate resourcing of supply chain/ contract networks auditing, training and 
education through an industry fund.  
Postal services  
1. Australia Post is a critical part of Australian infrastructure, delivering  letters, parcels and 
services that are essential to Australian communities and businesses.  
2. Labor will maintain Australia Post in full public ownership.  
3. Labor will maintain Australia Post as the sole carrier of the standard -size letter service, and 
the sol e issuer of postage stamps. Flat -rate postal charging arrangements will be protected to 
ensure universal and equitable access to all Australians, metropolitan and regional.  
4. Labor will encourage the growth of Australia Post ’s service oﬀering and ensure Aust ralia Post ’s 
community service obligations provide equitable access to a full range of essential services for 
all Australians.  
5. Labor commits to ensuring community service obligations meet the needs of the Australian 
people and Australian businesses. Labor commits to have the ACCC retain price oversight on 
all letter delivery.  
6. Australia Post should maintain appropriate coverage of post oﬃce outlets and street post 
boxes throughout Australia. Labor will ensure the ownership mix between corporate retail 
outlet s, franchisees and licensed post oﬃces is  maintained.  
7. Postal services are the lifeblood of many rural and regional communities. Labor will work to 
maintain  and strengthen  the service  oﬀering  of Australia  Post  in rural  and regional  Australia  
through Post Oﬃces, including continually improving Australia Post ’s service delivery 
capabilities and its digital services.  
8. Australia Post employs thousands of Australians. Labor will work to protect the jobs of these 
workers, encourage Australia Post towards dir ect full -time employment rather than contract 
work, and endeavour t o ensure contractors will not be used to undermine the current 
entitlements of direct employees.  
9. Labor will ensure postal workers continue to play a strong role in both mail and parcel deli very, 
and will encourage consultation  and collaboration  between  Australia  Post  and unions  to 
address  and overcome  any challenges.

Delivery of government services  
1. Labor will:  
a. ensure government service delivery is appropriately resourced to deliver quality a nd 
timely services to Australian citizens;  
b. Increase the skills and capacity of staﬀ in all areas of customer engagement;  
c. Maintain a robust, responsive and contemporary digital information system;  
d. Maintain a network of accessible service centres , access po ints and agents  throughout  
metropolitan and regional  Australia capable of providing real time performance 
information to citizens;  
e. Pursue a Service Delivery Reform agenda to improve choice and standards in delivery;  
f. Establish an e -citizens Charter promoting transparency, accountability and democratic 
participation;  
g. Redirect resources saved by digital service delivery to deliver intensive case management 
programmes for those in greatest need, ensuring digitally exclud ed citizens are not 
disadvantaged;  
h. Integrate and promote, where practical and appropriate, Services Australia’s  digital 
platforms with other government digital platforms;  
i. Develop a departmental e -Government research centre laboratory in line with 
internati onal best practice from within existing departmental resources. The laboratory 
will conduct research aimed at continuously improving both Services Australia ’s digital 
service delivery oﬀerings and those across other government departments and agencies; 
and 
j. Protect the integrity and privacy of the personal records of Australians using government 
services by keeping all data and processing work associated with the delivery of 
government services within the public service, and ensure each government department / 
agency has employed a Privacy and Information Oﬃcer.  
Stronger public sector  
1. The Australian Public Service and the wider public sector have a crucial role to play in serving 
our community and shaping the future of our nation. However , years of cuts and outsourcing 
has undermined the capacity and capability of the public service. Labor is committed to building 
a stronger public service that delivers better outcomes for the community, contributes to 
building a fairer and more inclusive A ustralia, and is a better place to work.  
Rebuilding public sector capability  
2. Labor will:  
a. Increase the number of direct, permanent jobs in the public service, and reduce the use 
of contractors, casual, labour hire and non -ongoing positions ;
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
112 
 
 
b. Establish and ma intain agency funding levels commensurate with service delivery and 
policy development requirements, and provide adequate agency funding across the 
whole of the APS ; 
c. Abolish the Average Staﬃng Level cap in the public service and stop wasting taxpayers 
mone y on contractors, consultants and labour hire ﬁrms for work that could be done more 
eﬀectively by public servants, with savings reinvested into rebuilding public service 
capability through secure jobs ; 
d. Work with trade unions and employees, to take meaningf ul steps to replace the Eﬃciency 
Dividend (ED) with genuine targeted eﬃciencies and productivity improvements. Labor 
recognises that the ED is no longer an eﬀective public policy measure for generating 
eﬃciencies and has had a damaging eﬀect on public sect or jobs, service delivery and policy 
capacity ; 
e. Ensure contracting and labour hire is not used as a vehicle to cut wages, conditions or job 
security for public servants, including by government agencies being required to ensure 
labour hire ﬁrms pay the same  wages and conditions as directly employed public servants ; 
f. Develop a Workforce Strategy to address current and future capability requirements and 
which recognises the detrimental impact of outsourcing and labour hire and will rebuild 
internal capacity.  
Procurement consultants, contractors, and labour hire 
3. Labor will ensure government procurement decisions consider the impact on public sector 
service delivery and policy development capacity and do not create perverse incentives that 
reduce the internal capa bility and corporate knowledge of government agencies. Agreements 
with contractors and consultancies should require knowledge transfer and capability building 
where possible to reduce long term reliance on outsourced labour.  
4. Labor will strengthen transpare ncy and accountability in monitoring and reporting on 
government contracting by:  
a. Requiring procurement government spending data to be collected on a central database, 
including tender notices, contract reporting and consultancy spending;  
b. Clearly deﬁning contractors and consultants and establishing broader reporting categories 
to ensure all data is adequately captured and transparently reported; and  
c. Requiring agencies to keep records of sub -contractors used and properly track the status 
of their no n-APS workforce including the number, level, cost and length of service of 
labour hire staﬀ and contractors.  
Public sector industrial relations  
1. Labor will work with the public service and unions to build an eﬀective public sector with fair and 
equitable co nditions of employment and job security.  Labor will:  
a. End the pay and conditions disparities that exist across the public service by supporting a 
single, uniﬁed Australian Public Service and addressing pay inequities through an agreed 
mechanism to achieve e qual pay for work of equal value across the APS, and take active
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
113 
 
 
steps to address pay inequities in low -paying public sector agencies with a high proportion 
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staﬀ;  
b. Ensure Commonwealth agencies undertake genuine, fair  collective bargaining and 
recognise the Commonwealth as a single employer where core APS -wide terms and 
conditions are negotiated in good faith at a service -wide level and remaining conditions 
negotiated at an agency, group of agencies or portfolio -wide l evel as appropriate;  
c. Lead by example on addressing the ill eﬀects of family and domestic violence by 
introducing public -sector wide standards of paid leave and other supporting entitlements 
for workers who are aﬀected by family and domestic violence ; 
d. Ensur e genuine, good faith consultation on all matters aﬀecting employees in the 
workplace ; 
e. Facilitate support for the role of trade union delegates in the workplace, and their rights 
to communicate with workers, access the workers they can represent, paid leav e to 
attend union training and time to fulﬁl their roles;  
f. Recognise employees ’ rights to exercise genuine freedom of association and the right to 
organise in a union including by giving workers the right to access union delegates and 
union representation a t work, during working hours and in their workplace;  
g. Recognise the right of public servants to hold and express political views as private 
citizens, limiting restrictions to this right to actions and expressions which genuinely 
undermine their capacity to serve the public;  
h. Ensure that Government workplaces provide best practice work health and safety, 
including through supporting the role of workplace health and safety representatives and 
recognising the role of unions in health and safety ; 
i. Enable public se rvants to balance work and family responsibilities;  
j. Take active steps to increase the proportions of First Nations peoples and people with a 
disability employed in the APS and ensure they have access to meaningful career 
development ; 
k. Ensure service -wide pr oductivities are recognised as eﬃciency gains by Australian Public 
Service agencies and that these gains are shared between government, employees and 
the community;  
l. Ensure secure, comprehensive, service -wide standards and classiﬁcations, and ensure 
interna l appeal and review rights;  
m. Secure superannuation arrangements in industrial instruments, and maintain at least 15.4 
per cent employer contribution to the superannuation of federal government employees, 
regardless of choice of fund;  
n. Expand APS workforce en try points, such as cadetships and other targeted programs, and 
improve career development pathways ; and  
o. Act as a model litigant in any proceedings before the Fair Work Commission .

Aged care services  
1. Labor recognises that one streamlined home and community  care program is being implemented 
but we recognise and support the need for some services to continue to receive block funding 
post the transition date of 30 June 2022. Labor in Government would continue to block fund some 
services past this transition da te. 
2. Labor will work with stakeholders to investigate and facilitate the continuation of home and 
community care services that are currently delivered by local governments, particularly those in 
Victoria.  
Sexual and reproductive health  
1. Labor recognises that there are unique barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health 
services, and particularly contraception and termination. As well as legal barriers in some states 
and territories, these include a lack of aﬀordability and accessibility , poor service provision in 
many regional and rural areas and issues of reproductive  coercion.   
2. Labor will work to improve sexual and reproductive health for all Australians and supports the 
rights of individuals to make decisions regarding their reproduct ive health, particularly the right 
to choose appropriate contraceptives and termination or to continue with their pregnancy. Labor 
will ensure these choices are supported by access to relevant medical, support and advice  services.  
3. As part of this, Labor will:  
a. Support awareness of, access to and uptake of modern contraceptives, particularly long 
acting reversible contraceptives ; 
b. increase  the availability  of culturally  sensitive  and accessible  sexual  and reproductive  
health  services;  and 
c. Work with sta tes and territories to improve legal protections, such as safe access zones 
for women seeking termination services, as well as expand service provision in the 
public  system . 
Territories  
1. Labor recognises that Australia needs special arrangements between the  Commonwealth and the 
External Territories tailored to the particular needs and circumstances of each territory.  We will 
maintain and improve the legislative framework for non-self-governing  territories and improve 
the services they enjoy so they have:  
a. opportunities as far as possible equivalent to mainland Australians;  
b. a diversified economy based on the strengths, needs and aspirations, populations and 
environments of each;  
c. economic, social and cultural development appropriate to the needs, aspirations and 
circumstances of each territory;
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
115 
 
 
d. governance arrangements that are equal, fair, and sustainable and reflect islanders’ desire 
for real decision -making power, responsibility and a level of autonomy; and  
e. access to all protections under Australia’s Human R ights Framework.  
Civil society  
1. Labor acknowledges the crucial role of Civil Society in Australia’s democracy and its role in 
advocacy and influencing government  policy. Labor notes the role of civil society in addressing 
pre-existing fault lines in our pol itical, social, and economic systems that have been exposed and 
deepened through the eﬀects of COVID -19. 
2. Labor is committed to working closely with Civil Society organisations as we recover from the 
pandemic and reimagine a new Australia. We will acknowled ge, support, and engage with the 
expertise held within Civil Society.  
3. In pursuing a partnership with Civil Society, Labor will pursue the following objectives:  
a. establishment of an expert body to ensure the views of civil society are reﬂected in policy 
reform and initiatives to strengthen and build nourishing  communities;  
b. review the Recommendations of the 2010 Productivity Commission Report on the Not for 
Profit Se ctor;  
c. development of a national working with vulnerable people (WWVP) registration to ensure 
consistency and traceability across jurisdictions and to improve the safety of vulnerable 
people;  
d. work across jurisdictions to create a modern and standardised nat ional fundraising 
framework, reducing red tape and improving charities' access to donors and 
philanthropists;  
e. review and reform the funding models for contracted services to support longer -term 
planning and better service provision;  
f. recognise that non -prof it organisations are always better positioned than for -profit 
corporations to provide community services. In the procurement of community services, 
Labor will remove the practice of competing on labour costs by ensuring tenders and grant 
programs are su fficient and appropriately funded to provide for adequate and safe 
staffing levels, and fair and reasonable wages and conditions.  
g. recognise that community led organisations have been an essential part of delivering 
services and building community capacity. La bor will prioritise funding for specialist 
services, including specialist services delivered by women, LGBTIQ, First Nations, disability 
and CALD groups.  
h. ensure not -for-profits are free to advocate on behalf of their cause without fear of being 
deregistere d as a charity and that advocacy itself is protected as a government funded 
activity of community organisations;  
i. acknowledge and support the signiﬁcance of volunteer recruitment and management in 
Australia, particularly in responding to natural disasters a nd COVID -19, and ensure that
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
116 
 
 
frontline volunteers are given suitable access to workplace safety needs, such as COVID -
19 vaccinations and protective equipment; and  
j. support the not -for-profit sector in bridging the technological divide, so that more 
organisa tions, regardless of size or location, can access the digital economy and the 
productivity gains that technology can deliver.  
Privacy  
1. An individual’s right to privacy is a fundamental political, civil and human right must be 
protected.  Government should pr ovide a strong regulatory framework to protect people’s 
right to privacy and ensure the security of their personal information, whether held in the 
public sector or the private sector.  
2. Labor will provide a strong regulatory framework to protect people’s ri ght to privacy, in all 
states, and ensure the security of their personal information, whether held in the public 
sector, not -for-proﬁt sector, or the private sector, on paper or in digital form . 
3. Many services relied on by Australian consumers require them to provide very personal 
information about themselves to secure those services including employment details, income 
levels, credit/financial history and circumstances as well as family links.  
4. Labor believes Australians retain ownership of their personal in formation and it is essential 
Australians can have confidence their information is securely stored and accessed and in ways 
that enshrine their rights as they exist under Australian law.  
5. Labor substantially updated the Privacy Act 1988 to , among other thin gs adopt a risk -based 
approach to protecting personal information in their possession from misuse, interference or 
loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.  
6. Labor will maintain these objectives to ensure all personal data including health, financial and 
employment details are equally protected.  
7. Labor acknowledges particular community concerns about the offshore storage and access of 
their personal data.  In Government, Labor will continue to review the adequacy of offshore 
data storag e and privacy laws.  
8. Labor will continue to work to ensure the types of agencies with access to the data and 
purposes for which the data is available are appropriate.  We will ensure the current warrants 
scheme and the threshold conditions on warrantless acc ess are appropriate and freedom of 
the press is protected.  
Nuclear disarmament  
1. Congratulates the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons on its work in 
returning to global prominence the cause of nuclear disarmament;  
2. Acknowledges the value of the  Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (the Ban Treaty) 
and its aspiration to rid the world of nuclear weapons for all time; and
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
117 
 
 
3. Acknowledges the centrality of the US Alliance to Australia’s national security and strategic 
policy.  Labor in governmen t will sign and ratify the Ban Treaty, after taking account of the 
need to:  
k. Ensure an effective verification and enforcement architecture;  
l. Ensure the interaction of the Ban Treaty with the longstanding Nuclear Non -Proliferation 
Treaty;  
m. Work to achieve universal support for the Ban Treaty.  Labor will take urgent action to 
reduce the risk of nuclear war by continuing its proud record of seeking nuclear 
disarmament and non -proliferation by: 
n. Working to create the conditions necessary to achieve a pa thway to universal support for 
the Ban Treaty;  
o. Advocating to the United States that it actively negotiates with Russia, China and other 
nuclear armed states to develop a follow on treaty to the New START treaty with a view 
to realising the objective of Art icle VI of the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons (NPT ), namely , a world free of nuclear weapons; and  
p. Seeking to work with partners and allies to build upon the International Commission on 
Nuclear Non -Proliferation and Disarmament to deve lop an initiative which proposes a way 
of working with states possessing nuclear weapons to achieve Article VI of the NPT and 
encouraging transparency among all states with nuclear weapons in relation to their use 
doctrine and the composition of their arsenals, while continuing to strengthen non -
proliferation goals in the Indo Pacific region.  
Israel and Palestine  
The Special  Platform  Conference:  
• supports the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure 
and recognised borders ; 
• calls  on the next  Labor  Government  to recognise  Palestine  as a state;  and 
• expects that this issue will be an important priority for the next Labor Government.  
A nation built on migration  
1. Migrants and refugee s have made an important social and economic contribution throughout our 
nation’s history. Australia’s diversity is a source of national strength and a critical factor in nation -
building.  
2. Australia is, and will remain, a society of people drawn from a rich  variety of cultural, ethnic, 
linguistic and religious backgrounds. Australia is, and will remain, a multicultural society.  
3. Labor will enact policies that enable and promote the participation of migrants and refugees in 
social, economic and political life by recognising the value of Australia’s diversity and removing
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
118 
 
 
barriers to access and participation. Labor will ensure that our policies do not adversely impact on 
the ability of migrants and refugees to fully participate in Australian society.  
4. To support Australia’s multicultural society, Labor’s migration policies will:  
• Remain non -discriminatory;  
• Respect the heritage and traditional customs of migrants and their children;  
• Recognise the importance of all aspects of the migration program, including skilled, 
family and humanitarian streams;  
• Support Australia’s social cohesion by encouraging universal respect for Australia’s 
democratic beliefs and laws, and the rights, responsibilities and privileges of 
Australian citizenship;  
• Consistently oppose thos e who foster extremism, hatred, ethnic division or incitement 
to violence; and  
• Be evidence -based, supported by rigorous research and evaluation.  
5. Labor believes that there is an inequity for New Zealand citizens living in Australia under the terms 
of the Tr ans-Tasman Travel Arrangements (TTTA). Labor will consider the permanent residency 
status and potential citizenship arrangements for New Zealand citizens living in Australia under 
the terms of the TTTA.  
6. Labor affirms that every worker, no matter where they  have come from or what languages they 
speak, must be treated with fairness, dignity and respect inside and outside the workplace. Labor 
notes that migrant workers are at particular risk of wage theft, harassment, bullying, 
discrimination and unsafe practi ces and being trapped in the black economy by rogue and 
unscrupulous employers.  
7. Labor condemns operators whose business model is built on the disgraceful exploitation of 
workers who are forced to work in the black economy. The black economy refers here to  the 
shameful practice of running a business outside the tax and regulatory system, to gain an 
advantage and to try and get away with mistreating workers, often migrant and marginalised 
workers. These workers are ripped off and don’t receive lawful wages, benefits and are prevented 
from seeking legal protections.  
8. Some of the most abhorrent behaviour from operators occurs in the horticulture sector, where a 
significant number of employers operate entirely in the black economy. These operators exploit 
the wo rkers that feed us, and provide fresh produce to our communities. It is estimated that 
100,000 workers across Australia are operating as the backbone of the industry in an unregulated 
environment.  
9. Labor will work with trade unions to address the problem o f worker exploitation in the black 
economy. Conference demands better oversight, a review of and adjustment to the temporary 
work visa system as part of the solution for those migrant workers trapped in the black economy 
where workers are paid cash well be low award wages, not paid their superannuation and treated 
in a manner that is appalling to those who share Labor’s values of respect, fairness and dignity for 
all workers.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
119 
 
 
10. Labor will deal with the complex issue of those seeking Australia’s protection by giving expression 
to the values of compassion, justice, human rights, fairness and generosity. These are values which 
are at the heart of the Australian identity.  
11. Labor will treat people seeking our protection with dignity and compassion and in accordance with 
our international obligations, the rule of law and core Australian principles of fairness and 
humanity. Labor will legislate to enshrine our international obligations into Australian domestic 
law. 
12. Under the Refugee Convention, asylum seekers have the right to seek protection and asylum and, 
regardless of the mode of arrival, this is not illegal under Australian or international law. 
Accordingly, Labor rejects the practice of referring to asylum seekers as ‘illegals’.  
13. Australia must not harm people seek ing refuge.  
14. Family reunion for migrants and refugees is important to successful settlement.  
15. The issue of those seeking protection is both a global and regional one. Accordingly, in order to 
achieve a long -term resolution to the issue, it must be dealt with  through international 
cooperation and not unilateral action. Within our region, Australia must play a leadership role.  
Recognising the value of a bipartisan approach in this policy area in the past, Labor will work 
towards a bipartisan approach once again . 
16. A fundamental principle in treating those seeking protection with humanity is to provide as much 
certainty as possible. An aspiration of certainty in all matters around asylum seekers, including the 
duration of assessing refugees’ claims, must underpin A ustralian policy.  
17. Labor will work to ensure those in detention facilities are treated with dignity and respect and 
have access to an appropriate standard of care and substantive access to health and education 
services while held in immigration detention ce ntres.  
18. The world is experiencing its greatest humanitarian need since the Second World War with the 
largest number of displaced persons since that time. Labor believes that Australia should lead 
debate on the establishment of a best practice framework, inc luding new regional agreements 
and understandings required to ensure the Refugee Convention and the international protection 
system function effectively in this environment. Australia understands that such a framework 
must include working to ensure better support for those countries that host the great majority of 
the world's refugees and people seeking asylum, to directly address the needs and rights of 
displaced persons in these places. This includes encouraging countries in our region to provide 
protecti on to those in need and ensuring Australia responds by accepting our responsible share 
of the world’s resettlement of refugees . 
19. Labor acknowledges the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) as the international agency dealing with the world’s response to this humanitarian need. 
In pursuing Australia’s responsibilities as a civilised and modern nation, Labor will ensure Australia 
is one of the leading contributors to the global work of the UNHCR with  a significant increase to 
funding for UNHCR .
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
120 
 
 
20. Australia has a particular responsibility to show humanitarian and protection leadership in South 
East Asia. Accordingly,  Labor seeks a leading role working with South East Asian nations in the 
region and in pa rticular with Indonesia to build a regional framework to improve the lives of 
asylum seekers. Labor will give appropriate consideration to UNHCR refugee registrations to assist 
Indonesia and the UNHCR to work through the backlog. Subject to Australian vett ing processes 
and sovereignty concerns Labor will positively considered such refugees for inclusion within the 
increased humanitarian intake.  
21. To combat people smuggling Labor will engage with Australia’s neighbours to address ‘push 
factors’ by seeking inno vative, effective and lawful solutions to the irregular movement of people 
through the region. This approach will include multilateral engagement through Australia being a 
co-chair of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related  Transnational 
Crime (the Bali Process), and new and deeper bilateral arrangements of a type envisaged by the 
Regional Cooperation Framework agreed at the Bali Process Ministerial Conference in March 
2011.  
22. Labor will seek to ensure appropriate multilateral  infrastructure is in place to build a humanitarian 
regional framework which may include seeking to extend the work of existing multilateral 
processes.  
23. In recognising that addressing ‘push factors’ in transit countries will lessen the need for people to 
take a boat journey, Labor will work with the UNHCR to help build its capacity in South East Asia 
to pursue its mandate and assist the region’s asylum seekers.   
24. The phenomenon of people smuggling has a long history arising from the need for people to 
escape from danger and persecution. Labor also recognises that those who decide to leave a 
country in perilous circumstances have the right under the Refugee Convention to determine their 
means of departure. However, recognising the risk to life of people travelling on unsafe, 
unseaworthy and overcrowded boats often operated by criminal syndicates, Labor supports 
measures to reduce such journeys by working with regional neighbours and the UNHCR to 
eliminate any influence that people smugglers may have over vulnerable protection claimants by 
addressing people smuggling at its source, in countries of first asylum and transit countries.   
25. The most significant source country in South East Asia is Myanmar. Myanmar has undertaken 
enormous political and economic ref orms, but we are deeply concerned by events that have led 
to the large -scale movement of Rohingya refugees into neighbouring countries, particularly 
Bangladesh. Labor will work with Myanmar in the critical task of protecting human rights for all of 
its peo ple and ensure our aid and cooperation programs with Myanmar are suitably tailored to do 
so.  
26. In pursuing strong regional arrangements Labor will seek to ensure they provide access to 
protection in countries of first asylum and transit countries to deter s econdary movements of 
asylum seekers through:  
• The developing of capacity to improve accommodation, work rights, access to health 
and education services and other living standards for asylum seekers;  
• Expediting the claims for refugee status by asylum seeker s; and
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
121 
 
 
• The seeking of durable solutions.  
27. Labor will increase the humanitarian intake of refugees to create an orderly pathway to 
resettlement in Australia. This would help reduce the risk of asylum seekers being exploited by 
people smugglers and provide as ylum seekers with an alternative to boat travel to Australia.  
28. Noting Pacific Island nations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and these 
nations have expressed a clear desire for Pacific peoples to continue to live in their own c ountries 
where possible, and acknowledging Australia’s unique responsibilities in the Pacific, Labor will:  
• Support Pacific Islanders to remain in their homelands as the first response to this 
challenge;  
• Work to assist with intra -country relocations when ci tizens have to be moved from 
low-lying areas to higher ground; and  
• In the event that in the longer -term permanent migration becomes necessary for 
some Pacific Islanders, work in close consultation with the region to ensure that 
appropriate settlement is ac hieved.  
29. Labor will continue Australia’s contribution to international aid efforts to reduce the risk of 
displacement and to alleviate the pressing humanitarian needs of displaced persons  
30. Labor will act to eradicate the exploitation and wage theft experienc ed by temporary migrant 
workers working closely with trade unions by introducing a range of measures that deliver 
increased protections. Measures will:  
• Manage information exchanges between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the 
Department of Home Affairs to prot ect exploited migrant workers from unwarranted 
deportation and ensure they can come forward without fear to ensure investigations 
and prosecutions of employers;  
• Explore reforms to visa laws to allow migrant workers who have been exploited or 
underpaid to remain in Australia until the relevant legal processes for recovery of their 
lost wages and conditions to be finalised;  
• Protect international students from exploitation and reduce the ability for businesses 
to use the cash economy to systematically ignore  minimum award entitlements and 
exploit vulnerable workers;  
• Deliver better protections to working holiday visa holders who are subject to 
exploitation and underpayment;  
• Ensure employers not workers are the focus of exploitation investigations;  
• Increase fines for employers who breach obligations and employ people without work 
visas; and  
• Protect migrant workers from harassment, bullying, discrimination and unsafe 
practices.

31.  Labor recognises that shocking exploitation in the horticulture industry has persisted for too long 
without meaningful action by the Coalition Government. The current poorly designed and 
managed visa framework and its fractured approach to sourcing overseas labour gives 
unscrupulous employers and labour hire ﬁrms far too much inﬂue nce over vulnerable workers and 
a capacity to use worker exploitation as a business model. Such an approach has allowed for a 
collapse of wages and conditions in the sector and introduced a guest worker program into 
Australia by stealth. Labor notes the re putational damage inﬂicted on Australia by its failed 
management of the 88 Day Working Holiday Maker visa program and the conscripting of young 
holiday makers into a sector notorious for exploiting them. Australia must urgently address the 
horticulture sec tors structural dependence on visa workers and the exploitation and lowering of 
working conditions that this generates.  
32. As part of a broader review of the purpose and structure of Australia’s migration program, Labor 
will reform the Working Holiday Maker p rogram to better protect the rights and conditions of visa 
holders as well as assessing its impact on regional labour markets and industries.  
33. Labor supports reforms that protect the rights and conditions of all horticulture workers. 
Protections for workers  will be complemented by a more coherent overall visa framework that 
preferences permanent migration, the skills, training and employment of Australians, and the use 
of temporary overseas workers only when needed. This would be reinforced by stronger 
overs ight, enforcement and penalties for employers and labour hire ﬁrms that act illegally in the 
sector. Labor will work to ensure Australia’s horticultural sector is a highly proﬁtable, highly 
productive sector oﬀering good, secure jobs with fair pay and cond itions for all workers, including 
Australians and workers in regulated programs such as an improved Seasonal Worker Program.  
34. Labor condemns the exploitation of workers in Australia’s horticultural sector. Labor notes the 
multitude of government, parliament ary, non -government, union and academic reports that have 
highlighted this ongoing structural problem with workforce in horticulture. Labor will implement 
and advocate for policy reforms from opposition and in government that address this issue and 
immedia tely end the structural and endemic exploitation of workers that currently exists in 
Australia’s  horticulture sector.  
35. Labor supports workers in the horticultural sector being paid a guaranteed minimum rate for the 
work they do. Guaranteed rates of pay will  help end exploitation currently occurring via the 
gaming of piece rates and other illegal behaviour. Labor supports eﬀorts by the union with 
relevant constitutional industrial coverage to amend the Horticulture Award in order to provide 
minimum guaranteed  rates of pay for horticulture workers.  
36. Labor will appoint a Special Envoy for Refugee and Asylum Seeker Issues with responsibilities for 
advancing Australia’s interests and ensuring Australia plays a global role in the resettlement of 
displaced people.  
37. As the Government should have done, Labor will refer the United Nations Global Compact on 
Migration for consideration through the proper parliamentary committee process.

Australia’s humanitarian intake , settlement services and refugee assessment  
1. Those found to be owed Australia’s protection under the Refugee Convention, Complimentary 
Protection or and other international instruments will be given permanent protection under the 
Migration Act 1958.  
2. Those not found to be owed Australia’s protection under the Ref ugee Convention, Complimentary 
Protection or and other international instruments will be promptly returned only after any 
relevant legal avenues have been exhausted.  
3. Labor supports the existing definition of ‘serious harm’ and ‘persecution’ including the c urrent risk 
threshold of the ‘real chance test’.  
4. Labor will support a humanitarian migration program that reasonably responds to international 
humanitarian crises as they arise.  
5. In continuing Australia’s generous humanitarian program, Labor will provide ap propriate support 
for the travel and resettlement of refugees and others requiring Australia’s protection.  
6. State, Territory and local governments support refugees to settle in Australia.  Labor will facilitate 
opportunities for business, community groups, i ndividuals and State, Territory and local 
governments to participate in and support the resettlement of refugees through a community 
sponsored refugee resettlement program. Any community sponsored places should be in addition 
to the government’s refugee an d humanitarian program . 
7. Labor aspires to progressively increase Australia’s government funded humanitarian intake to 
27,000 places per year.  
8. Labor aspires to progressively increase the community sponsored refugee program intake to 5,000 
places per year.  
9. Temporary Protection Visas place refugees in an ongoing State of uncertainty and prevent 
meaningful settlement, creating hardship for refugees and denying Australia the benefit of their 
contribution.  
10. Labor will abolish Temporary Protection Visas and Safe Hav en Enterprise Visas and transition 
eligible refugees onto permanent visa arrangements.  
11. Labor believes protection claims made in Australia should be assessed and reviewed on the 
individual merits with procedural fairness ensuring our international human rights obligations are 
met. Accordingly:  
• The assessment and review of protection claims will be underpinned by robust, 
efficient and transparent processes that ensure fair and consistent outcomes, 
including access to review and independ ent advice;  
• The assessment and review of protection claims of specific lesbian, gay, bisexual,  
transgender, intersex and queer asylum seekers will be underpinned by appropriate
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
124 
 
 
and relevant assessment tools and processes that reflect cultural experiences o f the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, intersex and queer community;  
• The assessment and review of protection claims must be independent and free from 
any political or diplomatic interference;  
• The processing of protection claims must be streamlined to enhance the quality of 
decision making, to provide more efficient pathways for prompt resolution of visa 
status and to alleviate the courts’ immigration case -load burden; and  
• The Stone Review process will be maintained as an important mechan ism for ensuring 
the fairness of Australia’s security assessment system; and  
• Labor will create an independent Refugee Review Tribunal and abolish the 
Immigration Assessment Authority.  The Tribunal will allow for procedurally fair, 
simple, aﬀordable and acc essible processes and procedures, including in relation to 
adverse credibility ﬁndings, for the review of refugee related decisions.  
12. Labor will require the National Security Legislation Monitor to advise on establishing other 
mechanisms for:  
• Independent re view of the adverse security assessments that ensures procedural 
fairness while recognising that processes may be required to protect intelligence 
sources and methodology; and  
• The management of those whose adverse assessment is upheld.  
13. Labor will explore o ptions other than indefinite detention, including third country resettlement, 
to deal with refugees with adverse security assessments in a way that does not jeopardise 
Australia’s national security interests.  
14. Reporting on the ‘90 day rule’, which requires that refugee status determinations are concluded 
within 90 days from the time of application, has been an important accountability measure in 
ensuring the Government operates in a timely way in assessing protection applications.  
15. Labor will reintroduce the 90 day rule into the Migration Act.  
16. The existing fast track assessment process under the auspices of the Immigration Assessment 
Authority and the limitation of appeal rights does not provide a fair, thorough and robust 
assessment process for persons seekin g asylum.  
17. Labor will abolish this fast track assessment process.  
18. Labor believes the Refugee Convention plays a critical role in Australian law. Referring to the 
Refugee Convention in the Migration Act 1958 is good legislative practice.  
19. Labor will reintrodu ce the appropriate references to the Refugee Convention into the Migration 
Act 1958.  
20. Protection visa applications made in Australia should be assessed by Australians on Australian 
Territory.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L

21. Under legislation passed by Labor, complementary protection claim s should be considered by way 
of the protection visa framework.  
22. Labor will work to ensure asylum seekers have access to appropriate, independent, government -
funded legal advice while working through their claims for protection.  
23. In assessing asylum claims w here the fear of persecution arises from a person’s lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer status, the fact that the country the person is fleeing 
has criminal penalties for engaging in consensual homosexual sex is sufficient of itself to establish 
that fear of persecution is well -founded, and any assessment of the asylum seeker’s identity and 
fear must take account of the very different manifestations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
intersex and queer identity that other cultures, especially ones profoundly hostile to lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people, necessarily engender.  
24. Labor will ensure asylum seekers who self -identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex 
and queer will be assessed by of ficers who have expertise and empathy with anti -discrimination 
principles and human rights law. Officers, translators and interpreters at all levels of the 
assessment process will have specific lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer 
cultur al awareness training to ensure the discrimination asylum seekers face in their country of 
origin or transit are not replicated.  
25. Australia’s settlement support services are regarded as the best in the world. Labor will maintain 
this and accordingly will di rect sufficient focus and resources to our settlement services.  
26. Labor will provide appropriate English language tuition and tailored employment programs as 
essential settlement services which are critical to the achievement of full social and economic 
participation of refugees.  
27. Labor will seek to improve the availability and integration of Commonwealth -funded migrant and 
settlement services. Labor will ensure settlement service policies are:  
• Informed by advice from the Settlement Services Advisory Council, the Settlement 
Council of Australia and other key stakeholders and the community; and  
• Coordinated in partnership with State and Territory governments, local governments, 
community organisations and service delivery providers.  
28. Labor will ensure ser vices across government for refugees are culturally responsive, universally 
accessible and consistent with Labor’s social inclusion agenda.  Recognising the value of 
community support groups in providing settlement services, Labor will support the involveme nt 
of such groups.  
29. Refugee settlement can have a particularly positive effect in rural locations and these people play 
an important role revitalising rural and regional communities. Labor supports the settlement of 
suitable humanitarian entrants in regiona l locations with the support of State, Territory and local 
governments and local communities.

Australia’s border  and immigration detention  
1. For the Australian people to have confidence and trust in the integrity of our migration system, 
Labor will fund and maintain robust border security measures that support the orderly processing 
of migration to our country and protect our national interest and our national borders.  
2. Labor will ensure asylum seekers who arrive by irregular means will not be punished for the ir 
mode of arrival.  
3. Labor is united in its commitment to prevent further loss of life at sea of vulnerable children, 
women and men. Labor will:  
• Meet its obligations to the maritime principle of safety of life at sea which requires a 
response to assist in t he rescue at sea of vessels in distress;  
• Consider introducing further penalties for serious people smuggling offences; and  
• Ensure repatriation of crew members who are proven to be juveniles.  
4. To support Australia’s strong border security regime, Labor will maintain:  
• An architecture of excised offshore places; and  
• The non -statutory processing on Christmas Island of persons who arrive unauthorised 
at an excised place, except where other arrangements are entered into under bilateral 
and regional arrangements.  
5. Labor will take advice from the UNHCR in relation to any arrangements with third countries to 
ensure resources and commitments provide appropriate settlement support services to refugees, 
including health and welfare services.  Labor will prioritise establis hing durable and suitable third 
country resettlement agreements.  
6. Labor will ensure there is a strong, independent voice within government to advocate for the 
rights, interests and well -being of children seeking asylum within the immigration system, 
includi ng those in immigration detention. Labor will appoint an officer independent of the 
Department of Home Affairs, backed by the administrative resources and statutory powers 
necessary to pursue the best interests of those children, including the power to bri ng court 
proceedings on a child’s behalf. This will be done without reducing the Minister’s obligations in 
relation to unaccompanied non -citizen children.  
7. Labor will not pay people smugglers to engage in any form of people smuggling.  
8. Under Labor’s policies , unauthorised arrivals who enter for the purpose of seeking asylum will be 
mandatorily detained, for management of health, identity and security risks to the community. 
Labor will strive to ensure this is for no longer than 90 days.  
9. Labor believes communi ty-based assessment is the most reasonable, humane and cost-effective  
approach for supporting asylum seekers while their claim for protection is assessed.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
127 
 
 
10. Labor’s humane and risk -based immigration detention policies and practices will be guided by key 
immi gration detention principles, namely:  
• Detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and 
conditions of detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation 
and the services provided, will be subject to regular review;  
• Detention will occur in a Government -run immigration detention centre appropriately 
located close to services and relevant support and is only to be used as a last resort 
and for the shortest practicable time;  
• People in detention  will be treated fairly and reasonably within the law;  
• People in detention will be provided an appropriate standard of care including the 
provision of health, mental health and education services a standard consistent with 
that afforded to the Australian c ommunity; and  
• Conditions of detention will ensure the inherent dignity and safety of the human 
person.  
11. Labor supports the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Accordingly, Labor’s humane and 
risk-based immigration detention policies and practices will  include a commitment to ensure that 
after the necessary health, identity and security checks every humanly practical effort will be 
taken to remove children and their families from immigration detention centres into alternative 
suitable arrangements.  
12. Unla wful non -citizens will be subject to mandatory detention where they present a proven 
unacceptable risk to the community.  
13. Labor will not detain, process or resettle lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex refugees 
or asylum seekers in countries whic h have criminal laws against any of these communities as it 
makes these places unsafe environments for all of them.  
14. Labor recognises that successive Coalition Governments have failed to negotiate viable and timely 
regional resettlement arrangements, which has left refugees and asylum seekers including 
children languishing in indefinite detention. Labor believes that whilst these arrangements are 
negotiated, the Australian Government is not absolved of its obligation to provide appropriate 
health, security, and welfare services to asylum seekers. Labor will:  
• Work to negotiate on, and agree to, regional resettlement arrangements and resettle 
eligible refugees as a priority;  
• Continue to support the United States Refugee Resettlement Agreement and accept 
New Ze aland’s generous offer to resettle refugees by negotiating an agreement on 
similar terms as the United States Agreement; and  
• Ensure appropriate health, security, and welfare services for asylum seekers; and  
• Improve the medical transfer process, establish an Independent Health Advice Panel 
to provide medical advice and maintain ministerial discretion in all decision making.
STATEMENTS IN DETAI L    
 
 
128 
 
 
15. Labor will ensure all Australian Government involvement in detention facilities it operates or funds 
is subject to transparent, indepen dent oversight. Provisions for this oversight will be reflected in 
all contracts with service providers including through providing effective and consistent 
protections for whistle -blowers . Labor will use its best endeavours to provide for this oversight i n 
any relevant international agreements, including by enabling Com care to fulfil its regulatory 
obligation to investigate all serious matters within Australian -funded onshore immigration 
detention centres and offshore regional processing centres.  
16. Recognising the inequities of the policy of charging immigration detainees a daily maintenance 
rate while in immigration detention, Labor extinguished such detention debts and will oppose any 
attempts to reinstate this practice.  
17. As soon as the reasons for mandatory detention have ceased every effort must be made to remove 
asylum seekers from immigration detention centres through community detention or the granting 
of bridging visas with work rights. People seeking asylum will have means -tested access to fun ded 
migration assistance, and to appropriate social services, including income, crisis housing, 
healthcare, mental health, community, education and English as a Second Language support 
during the assessment of the claim for protection.  
18. The provision of se rvices at immigration detention centres will remain with private sector 
contractors for the term of the current contracts. In evaluating the future form of detention facility 
service provision,  the views of all stakeholders, including the relevant trade un ions must be taken 
into account.  
19. Labor will legislate to impose mandatory reporting of child abuse in all onshore immigration 
detention facilities and offshore regional processing centres and work with all State and Territory 
governments to ensure all unac companied minor refugee children are covered by the relevant 
child protection authorities.

Chapter 1  
A strong  and secure  Australia  
Labor  notes  that 83 per cent  of jobs in manufacturing  are good,  secure  jobs with  many  of these  in 
regional  Australia. Australia  needs  more  of these  valuable  industries  and the jobs they  create,  not 
less.  
Australia has the innovative capacity, the highly skilled workforce, the industrial base, the capital 
markets and the  natural resources necessary to be a world leader in any industry of its choosing it 
merely lacks the will and the vision  to make  it happen.  
Labor understands the value -adding, economic multipliers  that manufacturing jobs bring to 
Australian cities,  suburbs  and regions.  
The shortages and supply -chain interruptions caused by the COVID -19 pandemic made plain the risks 
to Australia  from  an over -reliance  on imports  of critical  materials  and essential go ods. 
Shortages in face masks, hand sanitiser and other PPE and now vaccines have shown that Australia 
urgently needs a  strong, growing, high tech and diverse manufacturing industry. Such shortages also 
demonstrated that rival nations  act ruthlessly in thei r own self -interest and supply chains are not as 
market driven or dependably free of  government  interference  as previously  believed.  
Australians rightly expect that their nation and governments should be able to produce or guarantee 
access to the  goods tha t its citizens and businesses need. Such independence is the cornerstone of a 
resilient Australian economy,  society and nation state. Labor understands that the world will not 
return to the old and comfortable arrangements  and that our region and world wil l be more 
uncertain and more prone to unpredictable behaviour from those who  wish to do us harm. Labor 
will act to safeguard Australia against such threats through a smart, eﬃcient and robust  sovereign  
capability  policy.  
Labor will ensure Australia’s suppl y of vital goods like food, medicines, water, communications, 
energy and other  necessities required by a modern economy are secure from disruption and 
overseas dependence. Labor will  urgently  work  to expand  its vaccine  and domestic  pharmaceutical  
industrie s to keep  Australians  healthy.  
Labor thanks and celebrates our blue, pink and ﬂuoro collar heroes who kept Australia moving 
during the height of  the pandemic. The pandemic has shown the importance of tangible and tactile 
work and also highlighted the risks  that front -line workers  take  each  and every  day,  risks  that were  
multiplied  by COVID -19 
Labor considers that Australia’s essential workers need and deserve a pay rise, not a pay cut, and 
condemn any  attempts to reduce their wages and conditions. Labor notes that essential services 
workers have either had their  wages  stagnate  or reduce  in real terms  and will work  to urgently  
reverse  this manifest  unfairness.
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
131 
 
 
Front line essential services workers many of whom live in suburban and regiona l Australia have 
demonstrated  themselves to be the backbone of Australia’s economy and deserve our enduring 
respect and thanks. Labor stands  with  our heroes.  
Commonwealth  infrastructure  and building  procurement  
A Federal Labor government will crack down on  waste, delays and failure in infrastructure delivery 
by ensuring there  are appropriate  delivery  models  and expertise  in projects  funded  by the 
Commonwealth.  
In the building and construction space, Labor will repeal the Code for the Tendering and 
Performance of Building Work  2016  and replace  it with  a comprehensive  procurement policy  which:  
• ensures  environmentally  sustainable  outcomes  in government  buildings  and infrastructure;  
• maximises  apprenticeship  opportunities;  
• ensures  secure  supply  chains  and the fair treatment  of workers  within  supply  chains;  
• develops  and promotes  the Australian  manufacturing  industry;  
• promotes collective agreements that reﬂect and support best practice industrial relations 
and employment  practices;  
• ensure  compliance  with  work  health  and safety  laws  and encourages  best  practices;  
• prevents the victimization of employees as a result of their choice to be a member of a 
union, and promotes the  important  and legitimate  role of unions  and union  delegates;  
• supports and enhances the right of workers to join and fully participate in the activities of 
their union, including  collective bargaining as well as the facilitation, training and adequate 
protection of the role of union delegates and  health  and safety  representatives  in the 
workplace;  
• recognises  the legitimate  role of union  oﬃcials  in enrolling  and representing  workers  on site 
or in the workplace;  
• ensures that any work which is to be sub -contracted is performed by bona ﬁde contractors 
only via responsible  contracting  arrangements; and  
• prevents  the use of non-conforming  and non-complying  building  products.  
Role  of public  transport  in Australia’s  economic  recovery  from  the pandemic  
This Conference  acknowledges  the dedication  of Australian  public  transport  workers  during  the 
COVID -19 pandemic. As the pandemic showed, public transport workers play a vital frontline role in 
the provision of services  that are essential to our society and our economy. Safe, reliable and
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
132 
 
 
eﬃcient public transport services  with secure  jobs will be crucial  to bringing  our cities  back  to full 
speed,  and to facilitating  Australia’s  economic  recovery.  
The pandemic has led to dramatic reductions in public transport patronage across the board. At the 
same time,  some State Governments - notably the South Australian and NSW Governments are 
continuing with job -destroying  public  transport privatisations  programs.  
This Conference:  
• recognises the role of public transport services and public transport workers in the economic 
life of our major  cities;  
• asserts that maintaining eﬀective urban public transport networks is in the national interest;  
• condemns the public transport privatisation agendas of the NSW and South Australian 
Government;   
• supports  a more  active  role for the  Federal  Government  in funding  public  transport  
infrastructure;  
• contends that federal funding for urban public transport infrastructure funding should be 
contingent on State  guarantees that service provision related to that infrastructure will not 
be outsourced, f ranchised, contracted out or  otherwise  privatised; and  
• supports a public transport industry which provides secure jobs for Australian workers as a 
pivotal plank for  Australia’s  economic  recovery.  
Local government  
A Labor  government  will: 
• focus on the long -term ﬁnancial sustainability of Local Government through increases to 
grant allocations,  including  fair increases  to Financial Assistance  Grants;  
• restore full Local Government representation, including voting rights, to the peak Ministerial 
Council of  the  nation,  currently  National Cabinet; and  
• re-establish  the Australian  Council  of Local  Government . 
Housing and construction  
Labor  recognises  the signiﬁcant  contribution  the housing  and construction  sectors  play in the 
national  economy. Conference is of the view that a Ministry for Housing, Construction and 
Infrastructure would be a desirable way to  better coordinate industry and procurement policy for 
infrastructure and the built environment to maximise the  beneﬁt  the sector provides  to Australian  
workers  and to the economy  as a whole.

Chapter 2 
Jobs  
For Labor, jobs are the cornerstone of success for the economy, families, and individuals. Labor will 
foster business  growth  to create  secure  jobs and promote  full-time  employment.  
Where part-time and casual jobs are preferred by Australians, Labor will ensure their wages, 
conditions and safety  are protected.  
Labor acknowledges that underutilisation rates, rather than just unemployment, are a key measure 
to the health of  our society. This focus on good and secure jobs will support Australians in our 
regions, suburbs, and cities to be  engaged in society, have pride in their contributions, develop skills, 
be healthy and happier, and more ﬁnancially  secure.  
Secure  work 
Australian s need a job, a secure job and a fairly paid  job if they’re  to be able to learn in their youth, 
buy a home, raise a f amily, and  retire  comfortably.  
Labor acknowledges that the cause of many social and economic issues in Australia are exacerbated 
by the ris e in insecure  work.  
Labor will promote the creation of secure jobs which have the protections and certainty needed to 
respond to  changes  in rights, diversity,  safety  and working  hours.  
Portable  entitlement  funds  
Labor supports the operation of employee por table entitlement funds as a method to deal with the 
protection of  workers  entitlements,  particularly  in industries  with  itinerant  patterns  of employment.  
Security of payment laws 
Labor opposes corporate structures designed to undermine workers’  rights and the right to 
collectively bargain.  Labor is committed to protecting the rights for small business, including 
ensuring security of payment in the building a n d construction industry . The recommendations in 
Review of Security of Payment Laws: Building Trust and  Harmony, prepared by John Murray in 2017, 
including in relation to the implementation of statutory trusts, must be  implemented  immediately.  
Sham  contracting  
Labor acknowledges that sham contracting is an endemic form of wage theft in the economy and, in 
particular, the  construction industry. However, the current provisions in the Fair Work Act 2009 
relating to sham contracting are  insuﬃcient  and have  proven  ineﬀective.  
The Fair Work  Act 2009  should  be amended  to:
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
134 
 
 
• introduce a speciﬁc prohibitions on sham contracting which applies not only to a person 
(employer), but also  to any interposed  entity  (including  corporations,  partnerships  and trusts)  
used  to engage  a worker;  
• remove provisions which enable employers to escape liability for sham contracting oﬀences 
by requiring  recklessness or proof of a state of mind. An employer ’s state of mind should not 
be a critical fact in  determining whether a breach has occurred. This en courages a scenario 
whereby the less knowledge of the  law an employer has, and the less attention they give to 
the issue, the more likely they will be able to  successfully  raise  a defence.  
Bullying, sexual harassment and gendered violence  
This Conference:  
• Recognises that workers’  rights sit at the core of the Australian Labor Party’s values, and that 
workplaces free of gendered  violence  are a fundamental  right of  all Australian  workers.  
• Recognises that a number risks and hazards are present in political wor kplaces making them 
high risk to  bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and gendered violence. These risks 
include but are not limited to  asymmetric  power imbalances  and cultural  approaches  to 
work.  
• Recognises that these risks are present in all political workplaces, including ALP workplaces.  
Commits to working at the national level and with state branches to ensure mandatory 
training for  parliamentarians  and staﬀ.  
• Commits to fostering an environment where political staﬀers and all workers in poli tical 
workplaces can  organise  for their safety  at work.  
• Commits to fostering a positive approach towards workplace health and safety training and 
reporting in  workplaces.  
• Commits to ensuring workers and volunteers have access to independent complaints 
proc esses with the  ability  to deliver real outcomes  and sanctions.  
• Recognises that gender equality is essential to achieving safe workplaces, and will take 
positive steps towards  building  that equality  in consultation  with  workers  and their  
representatives.  
• Places on the agenda for the next National Conference a report from the leader of each 
federal and state  parliamentary party on their progress towards creating better, safer and 
more inclusive workplaces in their  parliament  and political workplaces.  
COVID -19 vulnerable  worker  payment  
This Conference notes that despite the rollout of COVID -19 vaccines, the COVID -19 pandemic will 
continue to be a  threat  to the health  and welfare  of Australians  for some  time  to come.
RESOLUTIONS

It is likely that Australia will continue experiencing small localised outbreaks of COVID -19 until the 
pandemic has  passed. While many working Australians can choose to work from home, others in 
frontline service occupations do  not have that option. For workers with pre -existing health 
conditions, this may mean they have to risk their health  (or even  their lives) to  maintain  an income.  
To that end,  this Conference  notes  the Rail,  Tram  and Bus Unions  Protect  COVID -Vulnerable  Workers  
campaign.  
Conference supports a federally -funded scheme to  ensure vulnerable workers without access to paid 
sick leave  receive  a payment  to allow  them  to stay at home  and self-isolate  during  a localised  
outbreak  of COVID -19. 
Skills for technological change  
As technology drives growth, it sees jobs change, disappear and new jobs emerge. For this to be 
inclusive growth,  workers in changing workplaces deserve the opportunity to take advantage of new 
job opportunities through  industry skills training arrangements that support lifelong learning and 
equip existin g employees and new entrants  to the workforce with new skill sets that evolve with 
industries. Skill sets would support those in occupations with  low rates  industry  speciﬁc  
qualiﬁcations  to engage  with  learning  and to create  new  career  pathways.  
To ensure training is reﬂective of industry needs, that training results in a recognised qualiﬁcation 
that is portable for  workers and that training is properly funded as part of an overall industry strategy 
requires rebuilding a cooperative  tripartite  training  system of employer,  worker and  government 
representation.  
To ensure the economic beneﬁts of innovation are maximised and are distributed through inclusive 
growth, Conference  calls  on Federal  Government and Labor  to work  with  State and Territory  
governments  to ensure:  
• the needs of industry for new skill sets are mapped to identify skill shortages;  industry  skills  
and training  packages  are developed  to address  skill shortages;  
• that identiﬁcation of skill sets and shortages be carried out cooperatively with 
representatives of  workers,  employers  and Governments;  
• industry skill training and retraining packages be developed for existing workers and new 
workforce  entrants  to take  advantage  of identiﬁed  industry  needs  for new  skills;  
• assistance  be given  to workers  transitioning  within  or between  industries  to address  skill 
shortages;  ensure  industry  skill training  leads  to recognised  and portable  qualiﬁcations  for 
workers.  
Impact of COVID -19 and the need for a gender equal recovery  
The COVID -19 pandemic  has had a profound  impact  on women’s  lives  and has exposed  the true  
extent  of gender inequality  in Australia.
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
136 
 
 
Women are more likely to be in casual and insecure work; have lost more jobs and h ours of work 
and are twice as  likely to be on zero hour contracts; are more likely to work in low paid jobs; are 
more likely to not be ineligible for  JobKeeper; are more likely to have completely wiped out their 
superannuation account through the Early Rel ease  scheme; have a greater share of unpaid caring 
responsibilities; are experiencing increased levels of family and  domestic violence; are more likely to 
be subjected to violence at work, including record levels of sexual harassment;  and have been 
disprop ortionately impacted by the decision of the FWC to delay the Annual Wage Decision for only  
some  industries; mostly  female  dominated  industries  such  as retail.  
The COVID -19 response and recovery provide an important opportunity to reset our economy and 
addr ess these  inequities. Australia’s  workforce has transformed since the last economic recession 
and policies to stimulate the  economy need to adapt in order to support and strengthen women’s  
workforce participation. Policy measures being  considered  and implemented  must  ensure  a gender  
equal outcome  for women.  
Social assistance sector  
The social assistance sector – made up of workers in community and disability services among others 
– is the  fastest growing industry in Australia. It provides thousands of new jobs each year across all 
communities, especially  in regional Australia.  
Workers in social assistance sector are predominantly women, they are low -paid and they are 
undervalued by  conservative governments. In these sectors there is a high level of inse cure work, 
and a lack of investment from  Government  in training  and career  pathways.  
These workers make a diﬀerence every day in the lives of vulnerable Australians. They are highly 
skilled  professional workers. Their services are funded by Government to p rovide services to the 
community on behalf of  government.  They  deserve  better.  
Labor in Government will use funding mechanisms and regulatory powers to ensure there is decent 
work,  better living standards and fairer pay for workers in social assistance sec tors. These workers 
make a diﬀerence and  Labor  will be  by their side.  
Early  childhood  education  and care 
Labor has long recognised the vital role that early childhood education and care plays in the 
development and  education  of young  Australians  and in boosting  workforce  participation.  
Given its national importance, it is vital that the focus of the sector remains on providing aﬀordable 
and accessible high -quality  care  and not on  shareholder or investor  dividends.  
This Conference calls for Labor in gover nment to conduct an analysis of the sector to better 
understand costs and  fees and examine  the relationship  between  funding, fees,  proﬁts  and educator  
pay.
RESOLUTIONS

Aligning the Fair Work Act and Sex Discrimination Act  
Labor will amend the relevant sections of the Fair Work Act  to align with the Sex Discrimination Act  
to cover workers who  are currently  not protected.  
Chapter 3 
Climate change  
This Conference  recognises  that:  
• Three years ago, Labor committed to recognising a climate emergency. It is a commitment 
that we still hold. Action  on climate  change  is a Labor value;  
• In that three years, action on climate change has only become more urgent after years of 
Coalition neglect,  inaction  and denial; and  
• Climate  change  poses  an existential  threat  to our people,  our environment,  our jobs and our 
way of life. 
Accordingly,  Conference  resolves  that Labor takes an emergency footing in tackling climate change, 
adopting renewable energy at a rapid pace in order to  addres s the existential threat of the climate 
emergency and to reach Australia’s potential as a renewables  superpower.  
Ramsar Wetlands  
This Conference:  
• Restates Labor's support for the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International 
Importance, to which  Australia is a Signatory, and notes that Toondah Harbour is in the 
Moreton Bay Ramsar -listed wetland;  Recognises  the importance  of Ramsar -listed  sites  to 
migratory  wading  birds;  
• Acknowledges that migratory wading bird numbers are in steep decline, principa lly due to 
loss of tidal  roosting  and feeding  sites  along  their  migratory  routes  from  North  East Asia to 
Australia;  
• Commits to protecting Australia's intertidal habitat on which these birds depend, with 
special reference to  Ramsar  listed  sites; and  
• Calls o n an incoming Labor Government to fully apply Federal environmental law to protect 
Ramsar listed sites . 
Natural environment  
Labor acknowledges that Australia's natural environment is in an overall state of decline and many 
of our unique  species are threate ned as never before by a combination of intensiﬁed climate change
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
138 
 
 
and loss of habitat. It also  notes the UN Secretary -General's view that nature -based solutions could 
provide one third of the net reductions in  greenhouse  gas emissions  required  to meet  the goals  of 
the Paris  Agreement.  
For these purposes, Labor will revisit and reinvigorate historic programs initiated by previous Labor 
Governments. It will:  
• support the continued development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative 
National Reserve  System, identifying as a priority those areas where the need to halt 
biodiversity loss is most urgent and also  large  intact  areas  that are still able  to function  in 
ecologically  natural  ways;  
• work for the extension of Landcare programs which support envir onmental restoration and 
sustainable  agriculture, mobilising volunteer eﬀort but also assisting in the creation of 
employment at local and regional  level;  and 
• implement a strategic, landscape -scale approach to managing biodiversity, having regard to 
the Na tional  Wildlife Corridor Plan which provides a framework for large landscape -scale 
connectivity conservation at  regional  and continental level.  
Mine rehabilitation  
This Conference acknowledges that 50 years after it ceased operating, the former Commonwealt h 
owned Rum Jungle u r a n i u m  mine  in the Northern  Territory  still requires  extensive  rehabilitation.  
Labor  will work  with  traditional  owners  and the Northern  Territory  Government  to complete  the 
rehabilitation  of the Rum  Jungle  uranium  mine  as soon  as possible.  
Chapter 4 
Aged care  
Older Australians are being let down in our current aged care system. The recent Aged Care Royal 
Commission found older Australians care has been neglected in a system in crisis. However, the 
Royal Commission’s recommendations threaten to leave older Austr alians without the quality care 
they desperately need, and the Liberal Government has again failed to meet its responsibilities to 
treat older Australians with dignity and respect.  
The Commonwealth must commit to:  
o Taking responsibility for the aged care c risis facing older Australians including addressing 
short staﬃng and ensure proﬁts are not put before quality of care.  
o A legally enforceable care time guarantee that would give older Australians the safety, 
dignity, and respect they deserve.  
o Jobs with time  to care that ensure continuity of care and a secure workforce.
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
139 
 
 
o A decent wage and recognition of skills for all workers in aged care.  
o Ensuring workers have a voice in their workplaces. Aged care workers provide quality care 
and work above and beyond the ca ll of duty and know how to ﬁx this system.  
National Housing and Homelessness Plan  
Too many  Australians  don’t  have  a place  to call home. Labor recognises that owning a home of one’s  
own has always been the Australian dream and that access to safe  and secure  housing  is a basic  
human  right. Labor will therefore commit to the development of a National Housing and 
Homelessness Plan, which:   
• helps  more  Australians  to buy a home,  
• helps  Australians  who  rent,  and 
• helps  put a roof  over  the head  of more  homeless  Australians.  
Equal remuneration  
Labor in Government delivered Equal Remuneration for the social and community services sector. 
This sector is  made up of predominantly women workers, who se contribution to a cohesive, decent 
and kind society remains  undervalued.  
Labor understands the importance of this sector to the future of our nation. We will prioritise 
policies and  investments that better support workers and deliver quality, evidence -based services 
that put the needs of the  community  ﬁrst. 
Working age payment system  
Australia’s unemployment payment system is a barrier to many people getting into work. Payment 
rates have not kept up with wages or pensions; and payment rules are no longer ﬁt for the changing 
nature of work.  
Labor will work with experts on a process for reviewing the working age payment system to ensure it 
is helping people out of poverty and is designed to assist, rather than hinder, Australian getting back 
into the workforce.  
Supporting our public health system  
Labor notes that Australians expect our public health system to provide for their health needs from 
birth to death. Public health infrastructure, as it exists, has been paid for by taxpayers. The operation 
of the existing public health system is paid for by taxpayers. Ongoing improvements and expansion 
of the existing public health system must  be paid for by taxpayers.  
The ALP and a future Labor Government  will prioritise support for the public health system in  all 
Australian States and Territories. A future Labor Government will commit  to investing Australian 
taxpayers' money in public health services that provide equity and access to the Australian people.
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
140 
 
 
World -class health services will not be provided by wa y of extra fees and charges, but as a right as an 
Australian citizen.  
The ALP and a future Labor Government will have, as a core pillar of its policy and national platform, 
a commitment  to not privatise or outsource public health institutions, jobs  or services.  
Supporting LBGTIQ+ people  
Labor understands the critical importance of ensuring that the LGBTIQ+ community has equal access 
& opportunity  to healthcare, and appreciates the needs for specialist programs, support and funding 
for this unique community.  While many issues are pressing for this community, mental health and 
aged care will continue to be a focus for  Labor, and we are committed to removing all barriers to 
access and opportunity. Labor commits to ensuring no PBS,  Medicare or government service s will 
have a discriminatory impact on this community. In addition, education to  empower Australians to 
make safe, informed decisions about sexual and reproductive health will be kept up to date,  
reviewed  regularly  and include  all sexualities  and gender id entities.  
Labor acknowledges the needs and rights of transgender and gender diverse people to fair, equal 
and aﬀordable  access to health care services. For many, this may include accessing vital specialist 
health services and gender - aﬃrming medical technologies. Labor commits to removing, wherever 
possible, barriers to accessing these services  in consultation  with  medical experts  and government.  
Labor will recognise the bodily integrity of intersex persons, prohibiting modiﬁcations to the sex 
charact eristics of  people with innate variations of sex characteristics performed for social or cultural 
reasons, and ensuring respect for  intersex persons right not to undergo sex normalisation treatment. 
Labor commits to supporting the development  and implement ation with community participation of 
human -rights aﬃrming oversight and standards of care,  including  for accessing  lifetime  medical 
treatments  and procedures.  
Labor will develop a national LGBTIQ+ health plan to support LGBTIQ+ health and mental health 
including peak  bodies, antidiscrimination policies in Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Beneﬁts 
Scheme, ensuring medical  institutions and professionals maintain a strong understanding of 
LGBTIQ+ health issues, support for young  LGBTIQ+ people regardle ss of where they live, and suicide 
prevention polices for high -risk groups including LGBTIQ+  people.  
HIV 
Labor is committed to leadership in partnership with aﬀected communities and other organisations 
and clinicians in order to make HIV history. This lead ership will include restoring capacity to HIV peak 
organisations, new eﬀorts to promote HIV prevention, testing, and treatment in hidden populations. 
Needle and syringe programs have been critical in the prevention of the infection and spread of HIV 
and He patitis C, and Labor will continue to support these services.

Chapter 5 
Ending  violence  against women  
Violence  against  women  must  an end so that women  and their  children  can be safe at work,  in their  
homes,  on the street,  in their  communities,  when  socialising  everywhere. The cost of violence is too 
high and the consequences of exposure to violence are long -lasting and intergenerational.  
Labor  in Government  will approach  this challenge  with  urgency  and ambition,  ensuring  that:  
• the next National Plan  to prevent violence against women and their children includes sexual 
violence as a  central  focus  
• evidence -based primary prevention activities create the foundation for a long -term, 
sustained reduction in  violence,  including  by: 
o working with states and ter ritories to properly fund age -appropriate programs 
educating young people  about  respectful relationships  and consent;  
o supporting behaviour change programs to ensure perpetrators are identiﬁed and 
accountable for their  behaviours;  
• women who interact with Au stralian government agencies are oﬀered appropriate services 
and support the Australian government, states and territories work together to ensure 
people leaving violence are supported through specialised services, including legal services, 
counselling and  social support, housing and support for children ; 
• the Commonwealth leads a national law reform process to consider harmonisation of 
criminal laws governing  consent;  
• appropriate and adequate services are provided to First Nations people, LGBTIQ people, 
people from CALD  communities,  people  with  disability,  and people  living  in remote,  regional  
and rural  areas;  
• women  and children  are not impoverished  by leaving  violent  relationships;  
• women and children on temporary visas who are experiencing family violence can access 
appropriate  protection;  
• Australia’s  court  systems  deliver  justice  and avoid  additional  trauma  for victims  and 
survivors  
• the family law system appropriately responds to violence when making decisions about 
arrangements for  children;  
• that workplaces support women experiencing domestic violence, including through the 
provision of paid  domestic violence leave, and are governed by strong laws and processes to 
prevent and respond to sexual  harassment  and assault; and
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
142 
 
 
• we ensure  appropriate  structures  are in place  for women  to report  sexual  violence.  
Intersex policy responses   
Labor will ensure that the actions of a Federal Labor Government are informed by the Yogyakarta 
Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to sexual orientation, 
gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics and the Plus 10 Supplementary Principles. 
Further, Labor acknowledges the Darlington Statement as a guide to intersex policy responses within 
Australia.  
Chapter 6 
Local government  
This Conference resolves that a future Labor government will:  
• restore full Local Government representation to the peak Ministerial Council of the nation, 
currently National Cabinet;  
• re-establish the Australian Council of Local Government; and 
• focus on the long -term ﬁnancial sustainability of Local Government.  
A strong public sector  
Throughout COVID -19 our communities looked to the public sector for services, support and expert 
advice. The pandemic proved again what Labor has always known a strong society needs a strong 
and eﬀective public sector.  Conference notes, however:  
• The Coalition Government is engaged in the privatisation by stealth of the Commonwealth 
public service, through cutting more than 12,000 jobs while simultaneously increasing 
wasteful spending on consultants, contractors and labour hire companies to do the work 
previously done by public servants.  
• This privatisation by stealth has done huge damage to the capacity and capability of the 
public service to meet the needs of the Australian people while also condemning tens of 
thousands of workers to the risks and stresses of insecure work.  
• Even at the height of the pandemic when support for job creation was desperately needed 
the Morrison Government single -mindedly pursued privatisation and expanded insecure 
work arrangements in public service delivery. This included engaging 8,500 casual labour at 
Services Australia without creating a single permanent role.  
• The Morrison Governments push to privatise is also apparent in its obsession with attacking 
and undermining key national institutions such as the ABC, CSIRO and the ANAO.
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
143 
 
 
Conference recognises that a future Labor Government will need to undo the damage wrought by 
the Morrison Government’s policies, and indeed, to deliver on the promise of the Labor platform, 
Labor will need to unwind the privatisation and rebuild public service capacity and capability.  
Conference therefore welcomes the commitments in this platform to rebuild the public service, by 
abolishing the ASL cap, i ncrease the number of direct, permanent public sector jobs, reduce the use 
of consultants and outsourcing, and restore the independence of our vital public sector institutions.  
Criminal justice  
Australia has a higher incarceration rate than all the countri es of Western Europe and Canada 
imposing increasing costs on the nation and which fails to reduce recidivism, provide eﬀective 
outcomes for victims of crime or to make our communities safer. Learning from the experience of 
comparable countries Labor will s eek cross party cooperation to lead and encourage all jurisdictions 
to collaborate in supporting evidence based criminal justice policies to address these issues and 
which rely less on high cost and harmful prisons.  
Chapter 7 
Armed conflict  
Conference reso lves that an Albanese Labor Government will refer the issue of how Australia makes 
decisions to send service personnel into international armed conﬂict to an inquiry to be conducted 
by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Aﬀairs, Defence, and Trade. Thi s inquiry would take 
submissions, hold public hearings, and produce its ﬁndings during the term of the 47th Parliament.  
Collective  action  to protect Australians  abroad  
Labor recognises that protecting Australians overseas often requires the support of alli es. Labor will 
stand by Australia’s friends and take collective action when their citizens are under duress, 
particularly in cases of politically motivated, unlawful or unexplained detention by states.  
Visa  and asylum  processes  for human  rights  and democra cy activists  
Labor will ensure that character assessments for the purpose of claims to asylum, residence, or 
citizenship are not adversely aﬀected by non -violent democratic or human rights activism.  
Diplomatic  corps  and public  diplomacy  
A Labor Government will ensure Australian diplomatic missions and public diplomacy are 
appropriately resourced to respond eﬀectively to a rapidly changing geopolitical environment.  
Refugees  
Labor’s policy should be framed to provide a positive and compassionate ap proach by a Labor 
Government to the  treatment  of refugees,  rather  than  a reaction  to the punitive  and cruel  approach
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
144 
 
 
of the Coalition  Government. Refugees and those seeking asylum in Australia are to be welcomed 
under a Labor Government as assets who enhan ce this nation  and our economy  and provide  positive  
contribution  to our strong  multicultural  society.  
Labour  market  testing  
Labor in Government will legislate to ensure that temporary skilled visas are utilised only where 
suitably qualified Australian residents and citizens are not available and cannot be trained in a 
reasonable time. Labor supports the retention and improvement of labour market testing to protect 
the legitimate interests of Australian workers. Labor will develop a tripartite  process with unions, 
businesses and Government to support this process.  
Julian  Assange  
Labor believes that the Australian government should be doing everything necessary to ensure that 
Mr Julian Assange is treated fairly and humanely, and welcomes the pri ority given to the health and 
welfare of Mr Assange in the UK Court ’s decision. This includes ensuring that under no 
circumstances should Mr Assange or any Australian face the death penalty. The UK Court has found 
that Mr Assange should not be extradited t o the USA given his ill -health, and Labor believes it is now 
time for this long drawn out case against Julian Assange to be brought to an end.  
Preventing  nuclearisation  of the  Middle  East  
Labor expresses alarm at the potential nuclearisation of conﬂicts in  the Middle East, particularly with 
Iran moving towards nuclear weapons capacity.  
Labor supports the revival of the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan) between 
Iran, US, UK, Russia, France, Germany, and China, with reservations.  
Confere nce believes Iran, however, must whole -heartedly co -operate with UN, International Atomic 
Energy Agency, and other inspections and monitoring as provided in the Action Plan. There is no 
such thing as half -hearted veriﬁcation.  
Conference also calls on the A ction Plan to ensure that Iran undertakes not to send its troops and 
agents to foment civil war across the region.  
Conference agrees with Britain, France, and Germany, and now the emerging consensus in the US, 
that the interests of global security are best  met through an Iran nuclear agreement with robust 
veriﬁcation requirements.  
Human rights  
National  Conference:  
1. Strongly condemns the human rights violations against the Uyghurs and other ethnic and 
religious  minorities  in Xinjiang  and across  China.  
2. Notes:
RESOLUTIONS     
 
 
145 
 
 
a. that there is a growing number of reports of the mass arbitrary detention of Chinas 
minority  Uyghur population and other violations of human rights including forced 
labour, forced  sterilisation, sexual assault and restriction of movement in Xinjiang and 
across China. These are not the actions  of a responsible  global power.  
b. that China is a state party to the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial  Discrimination, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading  Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination  against  Women.  
c. urges the Chinese government to uphold its international human  rights obligations in 
Xinjiang and  across  China  and allow  unfettered  access  to Xinjiang  by the UN High  
Commissioner  for Human  Rights.  
d. notes that the US government and the Parliaments of Canada and the Netherlands have 
labelled the  human rights violations in Xinjiang as genocide, and that Human Rights 
Watch has labelled them as  crimes  against humanity.  
A future Labor Government will ensure that Australia stands up for human rights in China and work 
with the international community  to hold  China  to account  for its international commitments.  
National Conference c alls on the Australian  Government  to: 
1. provide its assessment of what is happening in Xinjiang and how it characterises the human 
rights  violations  that are taking  place  based  on all of the information  available  to its 
agencies.  
2. explain what actions it is taking to address the situation in Xinjiang and to provide support to 
Uyghur  communities  in Australia.  
Independent  Chinese  trade  union  movement  
Australian Labor recognises the rights of work ers living in neighbouring nations and trading partners 
to freely form and join democratic Trade Unions  
Unions and union members should be free from political interference.  
Trade Unions and unionised workforces are critical in reducing inequality, improvin g safety and 
lifting productivity in workplaces.  
Labor expresses its concern at the lack of ability for Chinese workers to freely and democratically 
unionise. This has serious repercussions for the rights of employees and citizens in our largest 
trading pa rtner. Suﬀering from excessively long work hours, unsafe and unhealthy workplaces and 
unjust remuneration is unacceptable in any modern society.  
Australia will support our neighbouring countries and trade partners in instituting legal frameworks 
which allo w unions to be freely created and for unionised workforces to openly thrive. Labor will

work to support workers wishing to better their lives through the power of the Trade Union 
movement both at home and abroad.  
South  China  Sea 
Conference notes that under international law the South China Sea, with a size of 3.5 million km, 
belongs to no one country. This important area of marine, navigational, environmental, and cultural 
signiﬁcance borders China, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, an d Brunei.  
We call for the South China Sea to be a zone of peace, with complete freedom of navigation for all 
countries. We call on all countries in the region to refrain from unilateral acts, militarisation, and 
other policies.  
In that context, under the a uspices of the United Nations, we call for an international -law framework 
to settle tensions and disputes between competing interests. In particular, we call on the major 
powers, including China and the United States, to abide by the International Court of  Justice, the 
Court of Arbitration in the Hague and other like bodies, seeking to mediate between particular 
nations.  
We call on all parties, including China, to abide by the decision concerning the South China Sea 
which was handed down on 12 July 2016 by the UN -appointed international arbitration tribunal in 
the Hague. A peaceful solution can only be achieved with a multi -lateral agreement which involves 
all nations under international law.  
Myanmar  
A Labor government seeks strong and enduring relations wit h the people of Myanmar.  
In February 2021, a military coup detat overturned ﬁve years of civil government in Myanmar. The 
coup followed the National League of Democracy (NLD) led government being re -elected in 
November 2020 with over 80 per cent of the vot e in internationally -observed free elections. The 
coup is a tragic step backwards for Myanmar and the use of lethal force by security forces against 
peaceful protesters is disastrous.  
The Commander -in-Chief has installed himself as supreme leader and claim ed for himself all the 
three powers of government: judicial, legislative, and executive.  
One of nearly 1300 people detained by the junta, Aung San Suu Kyi, the State Counsellor (equivalent 
to Prime Minister), is held incommunicado; though in early March sh e appeared at a court hearing 
via video conferencing.  
Labor will suspend military aid and associated support to the new regime.  
Labor will work with like -minded governments, particularly our ASEAN neighbours, to help secure a 
peaceful return to democracy i n Myanmar an objective which even the coup leaders profess they 
want to restore. Labor will also work for the restoration of human rights for all people in Myanmar, 
including minorities such as the Rohingya people, the stateless Indo -Aryan ethnic group who  
predominantly reside in western Myanmar.

in supporting Bashar Al Assad who routinely bombs, chemically gasses, and murders his own p eople.  
There are estimates that more than 200,000 Syrians have died in this conﬂict with millions made 
refugees.  
Conference supports democratic elements of Syrian society and their struggle to live free of 
persecution and the Assad regime.  
Tibet  
Labor call s on China to abide by its own constitution and laws which expressly allows for the cultural 
autonomy of the Tibetan people within the People's Republic.  
Tibetans must be allowed, as they are under Chinese law, to freely practice their religion, to learn 
and speak their language and to have oﬃcial documents in the language of the vast majority of 
people living in the Tibetan autonomous zone.  
Taiwan  
Labor calls for the maintenance of the status quo concerning Taiwan and China. Taiwan, a region of 
24 m illion people, should continue to enjoy democratic and free elections and freedom of religion, 
assembly, free speech and the rule of law enjoyed by a democratic society. Labor is concerned that 
Beijing and Taipei peacefully resolve diﬀerences and co -exist.  Labor rejects the use of military force 
to endeavour to change the status quo and calls on all countries to help facilitate peaceful relations.  
Hong  Kong  and the rule of law  
Labor supports long -standing Australian policy regarding the preservation of civi l and human rights 
in Hong Kong under the negotiated treaty between China and Britain. It calls on the authorities in 
Hong Kong to reverse the new national security law to release all prisoners goaled under this law 
and to allow democratic elections for th e Hong Kong legislature.  
Labor notes with concern China’s increasing interference in the aﬀairs of Hong Kong in 
contravention of the Treaty. In particular, Labor notes that China has disqualiﬁed elected legislators 
in Hong Kong, engaged in behaviour to har ass and curtail voices critical of China or advocating Hong 
Kong independence, and introduced the Hong Kong National Security Legislation which it has used 
to arrest and detain protesters and stiﬂe protest and free speech.  
Labor notes that under the Sino -British Joint Declaration of 1984, Hong Kong is to have a high degree 
of autonomy and to be administered under the policy of what is known as One Country Two 
Systems. In particular, clause 3(5) of the Sino -British Joint Declaration provides in part that in Hong 
Kong , "Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of 
association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of 
academic research and of religious belief will be ensure d by law ”.

Cyprus

invasion  in 1974 and  that Turkey  continues  to illegally  occupy  northern  Cyprus.  
Labor calls for Turkey to withdraw all its military forces from northern Cyprus and, in accordance 
with UN  Resolutions  367,  540 and 551,  de-recognise  the illegal  entity  known  as the Turkish  Republic
